         Ed wrote the basic framework, the institutional analysis, the corporate structure, the relations to government programs and the fundamental institutional structure of the media—that was basically him. He also did parts on some of the specific studies, like on the coverage comparison of a hundred religious martyrs in Latin America with one Polish priest. He did the comparison of the elections, which was partly drawn from a book that he had already done on
         <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2424046.Demonstration_Elections">
          demonstration elections
         </a>
         . I did all the parts on Vietnam and on the Freedom House attack on the media. Of course, we interacted on all the chapters, but the main division of labor was that.

         The reaction was quite interesting. Mostly the journalists and the media did not like it at all, of course. And, interestingly, they did not like the defense of the integrity of journalism: the last part, which investigated Peter Braestrup’s major, two-volume Freedom House
         <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/755389">
          attack on the media
         </a>
         for having been treacherous, for having lost the Vietnam war, and so on (which turned out to be a total fraud).
        </p>
        <p>
         I was probably the only person who read the actual document, both of the two volumes. One, the attack on the media, [the other] the documentary basis. Hardly any correlation between them! It was just literally total fraud!
        </p>
        <p>
         And what the results showed was that the journalists were courageous, honorable; they had integrity, they did their work seriously—but, of course, all within the framework of US government ideology. Like all the coverage of the war, like, say, David Halberstam. It was honest, serious, but, almost without exception, within the framework of the assumption that the United States is making a mistake by trying to save democracy in South Vietnam from Communist aggression. That is the picture. The idea that the United States was carrying out a major war crime by invading another country and destroying the indigenous resistance…. the facts were there, but not the framework of discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
         And they did not like that. Journalists would much prefer to be regarded as aggressive, independent, thinking for themselves, and if they were treacherous, well, OK, maybe they went overboard attacking the US government—that they much preferred. So as far as the journalists themselves were concerned, aside from a few exceptions, they did not like that picture of journalism as being honest, courageous and with integrity.
        </p>

         There were very few reviews of the book, but there was one critical discussion that I wrote about later, by Nicholas Lehmann [
         <b>
          New Republic
         </b>
         ,  1/9/89], a well-known scholar of journalism, who wrote a review in which he disparaged it, saying, “This doesn’t mean anything.”

        <p>
         For example, he discussed the chapter comparing the assassinations of a hundred religious martyrs in Central America, including an archbishop, American nuns and leading Latin American intellectuals—where there was virtually no coverage—with the coverage of the assassination of one Polish priest, where the assassins were immediately apprehended, tried, sentenced to jail—where there was vast reportage. This was one of our many examples of the way in which “worthy victims” are treated, as compared with “unworthy victims.”
        </p>
        <p>
         He said, “Well, this doesn’t mean anything, it is just because the media focused on one thing at a time, and they happened to be focusing on Poland, not El Salvador.” So, out of curiosity, I went to the
         <b>
          New York Times
         </b>
         index, and it turned out there was more coverage of El Salvador than of Poland during that period. But it does not matter, because this is a world of
         <i>
          alternative facts
         </i>
         . The media commentary is mostly propaganda and ideology. There were a few other critiques rather like that…but in the mainstream, it was basically ignored.
        </p>

         The first book that Ed and I wrote together,
         <a href="https://chomsky.info/counter-revolutionary-violence/">
          <i>
           Counterrevolutionary Violence
          </i>
         </a>
         , was published by a small publisher that was doing quite well. They published 20,000 copies of it, and were ready to distribute it. The publisher was owned by a big conglomerate,
         <b>
          Warner Brothers
         </b>
         , now part of
         <b>
          Time Warner
         </b>
         . One of the
         <b>
          Warner
         </b>
         executives saw the advertising for the book, and did not like it. He asked to see the book, and when he saw it, he went berserk and ordered them to stop distributing it immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
         The publisher at first did not agree. They said they would publish a critical volume with contrary views, but that was not enough. To prevent it from being published, in the course of the discussion, he just put the whole publisher out of business, destroying all their stock—not only our book, but all their books.
        </p>
        <p>
         We brought this to the attention to some civil libertarians at the American Civil Liberties Union. They did not see any problem. It is not government censorship; it is just a corporation deciding to destroy a publisher to prevent them distributing a book.
        </p>
        <p>
         We immediately started working on an expansion of the book:
         <a href="https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745335506/after-the-cataclysm/">
          <i>
           The Political Economy of Human Rights
          </i>
         </a>
         . The reaction to that was quite interesting. Many things were discussed, but there were two major chapters where we compared two huge atrocities going on at the same time in the same place, in South East Asia: one in Cambodia under Pol Pot; the other in East Timor, after the Indonesian invasion.
        </p>
        <p>
         They were very similar. Per capita, the East Timor atrocities were worse, as they killed a larger portion of the population; but they were comparable. The fundamental difference between them was that in one case, you could blame it on an official enemy and there was absolutely nothing to do about it—nobody had a proposal as to how to stop it.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the other case, we were responsible. The United States and its allies were crucially responsible. The US blocked action at the United Nations, provided the arms for Indonesia. The more the atrocities increased, the more the arms flowed. And there was everything you could do about it: You could just call it off.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reaction was, not a word on our chapter about East Timor; that disappeared. But there was a huge attack on our discussion of Cambodia. There was a huge literature on this, trying to show that we were apologists for Pol Pot. The reason for this was that we went through the media and said, “We don’t know what the facts are, we can’t know, but we will compare the facts available with what came out of the media filter,” and it was grotesque: There was lying at a level that would have astonished Stalin. So we went through that record. That led to total hysteria. Look it up, you will find a ton of literature about it. We recently published a new edition of the book, and we didn’t change a comma, because there was nothing wrong with it. But that is the kind of reaction you get with

         It’s now been almost 30 years since its publication, and the media landscape has, in many ways, changed greatly since 1988. I think perhaps the largest difference is the arrival of the internet and social media. One 2016 study showed that half of all British people get their news online now, with online news having overtaken television in its reach, and having far superseded it among those under 45 years old. Twenty-five percent of the UK receives its news
         <a href="https://medium.com/oxford-university/where-do-people-get-their-news-8e850a0dea03">
          primarily through social media
         </a>
         like
         <b>
          Facebook
         </b>
         or
         <b>
          Twitter
         </b>
         . In the United States, two-thirds of the adult population get news through social media, and that figure is growing at nearly 10 percent a year. Even the majority of over-50s
         <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/07/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2017/">
          use social media for news
         </a>
         . Could you speak about the internet and social media, its usage and the evolving media landscape with regard to the propaganda model?
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          NC:
         </b>
         I don’t think the internet and social media changes the propaganda model at all. The propaganda model was about the major media institutions and they remain, with all the social media and everything else, the primary source of news, information and commentary. The news that appears in social media is drawn from them. So, if you look at the news on
         <b>
          Facebook
         </b>
         , it comes straight from the major media. They don’t do their own investigations.
        </p>
        <p>
         As far as the major media are concerned, there is no fundamental difference. In fact, in some ways, they are a little more independent than they were back in the 1980s, partly because of changes in the society, which have opened things up to an extent. But fundamentally, they are the same. In fact, Ed and I did a second edition of
         <i>
          Manufacturing Consent
         </i>
         about 16 years ago, and we talked about the internet and whether to write anything about it, and we decided just to leave it alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         As far as social media are concerned, they are interesting in themselves. There has been a certain amount of study of them. What they have done is create bubbles. If you read the
         <b>
          New York Times
         </b>
         —which, incidentally, young people did not read much in the 1980s, either—but if you read the
         <b>
          New York Times
         </b>
         or the
         <b>
          Washington Post
         </b>
         , or even if you watch television news, you get a certain range of opinion, not very broad—it goes from center to far-right, but at least there is some discussion, and occasionally you get a critical voice here and there.
        </p>
        <p>
         On social media, that has declined. People tend to go to things that just reinforce their own opinions, so you end up with bubbles. And it is all across the spectrum. The people on what is called the left see the left media, the people on the right see the right media. And the level of material is, of course, much more shallow.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mainstream media, as we wrote in
         <i>
          Manufacturing Consent
         </i>
         , are a very significant source of news and information, and provide very valuable material. The first thing I do every day is read the
         <b>
          New York Times
         </b>
         , as it is the most comprehensive journal. You have to critically analyze what you read and understand the framework, what is left out and so forth, but that is not quantum physics; it is not hard to do. But it is a source of news.
        </p>
        <p>
         On social media, you do not find that. There are exceptions; there are internet journals that are very good—for example,
         <a href="https://theintercept.com/">
          <b>
           The Intercept
          </b>
         </a>
         —but most of it [internet and social media] is pretty shallow, and has led to a decline in understanding of the world in many ways.

         And, of course, there is the increasingly close relationship between these massive online monopolies and the US state. For instance, Jeff Bezos, the owner of the
         <b>
          Washington Post
         </b>
         and

         So they are essentially selling you to advertisers, just as the major old media do; they are also selling audiences to advertisers, but in a different way.

         are doing it by monitoring everything about you, so that somehow advertisers will be able to make more money approaching you. And that is very dangerous. And some of the things that are done and are not reported are quite interesting.

         <i>

         </i>
         interference in the election. It was not Russian. It was from the United States. A media company that works for nice guys like Trump, Le Pen and Netanyahu got together with
         <b>
          Facebook
         </b>
         , and the
         <b>
          Facebook

         office of Berlin provided them with extensive details of the kind they have on German voters, so then the media company could microtarget ads to specific voters to try to influence them to vote in a certain way. For whom? For Alternative für Deutschland, the neo-fascist party! Which probably is a factor in their surprisingly high vote.

         This was reported in the business press, so you can

         showing that automobile manufacturers are now so flooded with data from drivers of cars, that they have not yet worked out a way on how to get a business model, to allow advertisers to follow you every moment of your life.  There are already apps that you can get where they give you some free device, and in return you agree to have advertisements posted on the car dashboard the whole time you are driving. So if you are approaching an area where there is a certain restaurant, there will be an ad for that restaurant, things like that. This is really insidious, and it can be used in very dangerous ways, and sooner or later will be, I am sure.

         It should be a major headline every day that, alone in the world, the most powerful country in human history is not only refusing to participate in the efforts to deal with an existential crisis, but, in fact, is acting to exacerbate the crisis, pouring funds and money into more use of fossil fuels. Try and find an example in history of any political organization that was dedicated with passion to trying to destroy the prospect for organized human life. Even the Nazis were not doing that!

It is hard to find words to describe it. Instead of that, and plenty of other things that they are doing, what the media is trying to do is find some Russian interference in the election.

         Of course, these actions are not happening in a vacuum. There is a huge geopolitical backdrop, where Western and Russian forces are conducting a silent war in places like Ukraine and Syria.

         I think the media should cover Syria accurately and seriously, as a number of journalists—Patrick Cockburn, Robert Fisk, Charles Glass, Jonathan Randall—do. Those journalists cover it very accurately, that’s what they should be doing. Incidentally, you will notice that I mentioned journalists who write in England, not the United States. Serious coverage is much harder to find here. There is some, but not much. So the media should cover what is happening.

The fact that you ask is itself revealing. The Turkish invasion of Syria is quite serious, and it is threatening to destroy the Kurdish independent areas. It is not a joke.

         , that would tell you Obama had an affair with whomever. That is fake news. But now it has spread quite widely, but not really in the major media. I think they do pretty much what they did before. It is true that advertising revenues had declined for a time, but they increased with Trump. The television media in particular are delighted with the Trump phenomenon—you cannot turn on the television set without seeing something about Trump. And it is bringing in many more viewers. One of the CEOs of
         <b>

         during the presidential campaign that “for us, economically, Trump’s place in this election is a good thing,” that he has “never seen anything like it” and it is “going to be a very good year for us.”
        </p>
        <p>
         I happened to be overseas when the election took place, and I watched
         <b>
          BBC
         </b>
         for several days. It was 100 percent Trump! Nothing else in the world! Actually, the election was important, but it was important for quite different reasons that were not reported. For example, November 8, the day of the election, was an extremely important day in history. The World Meteorological Organization was meeting in Morocco and trying to put some teeth in the Paris negotiations. It had presented a dire picture of the impact of climate change on the world. As soon as the election results came in, the meeting basically stopped, and the question was, “Can we even continue when the most powerful country in human history is deciding to destroy our efforts?” That was the major news of the day, not the fact that some half-mad billionaire with huge media support managed to win an election. But it was not even mentioned. A couple of weeks later, I found some mentions in the back pages.
        </p>
        <p>
         As far as the election itself was concerned, the most striking feature was the Sanders campaign. The Sanders campaign was the first time in over a century of American political history that a candidate was able to get to where he did. Sanders probably would have been nominated if it had not been for the machinations of the Obama/Clinton party managers. But he did this with no name recognition, no funding from wealth or corporate power, and no media support or recognition—that is astonishing! That has never happened in American political history. In the United States, elections are basically bought, as I mentioned previously. This was a really striking phenomenon, but was barely mentioned in the media.
        </p>
        <p>
         By now, he is by far the most popular political figure in the country, but you hardly see a mention of him anywhere. He and his movement are doing lots of things, but they cannot get any reporting on it. Those are the really important things. And the
         <b>
          BBC
         </b>
         is the same; it is “Trump did this,” “Trump did that.”
        </p>
        <p>
         What Trump actually
         <i>
          is
         </i>
         doing is pretty clever. It is a dual program underway; Trump carries out one ridiculous antic after another. The media focus on it, the factcheckers start, and a couple of days later they say, “Well, this and that fact were wrong,” but by then, everyone has forgotten about it, and he is on to some new antics.
        </p>
        <p>
         Meanwhile, while media attention is focused on the megalomaniac conman who is working to attract their attention, the really savage wing of the Republican Party, the Paul Ryan wing, is busy dismantling every element of government that might help the general population, and dedicating themselves to their
         <i>
          real
         </i>
         constituency: the super wealthy and corporate power. That is happening in the background, while everyone is focusing on Trump’s latest antics. It is a good system and is working very well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Meanwhile, he is maintaining his base, who are under the illusion that somehow he is going to bring back jobs or that he is standing up for America. It is working quite well, and the media and the Democrats are in particular responsible for allowing it to continue.

         <b>

         , does this make the second filter of the propaganda model weaker, or, perversely, stronger, as media are more desperate than ever to appease their remaining sponsors? Furthermore, journalism appears to be becoming a less professionalized field, with fewer and fewer full-time staff journalists employed by newspapers and TV, and more freelancers and citizen journalists. In this context, what is journalism’s future?

         Media coverage is shrinking, but the part that is there is still professionalized. There are very good, professional correspondents in the field, analysts and so on, but there are much fewer of them. Take Boston, where I have lived for many years. The
         <b>
          Boston Globe
         </b>
         was a major, leading newspaper. It had international bureaus; it did the best coverage of Central America during Reagan’s wars. Now there are a few things apart from local news in it, and the rest is what they pick up from wire services. It is essentially hardly a newspaper anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
         That kind of thing is happening around the country, but it is not deprofessionalization, it is just a decline in the model of the media that had functioned. In part, it is being undermined by social media. If people can turn on the computer and get a couple of headlines, then go on with their lives, it is a lot easier than reading a newspaper and trying to figure out what is happening. So there is a general cheapening of the culture that is affecting the media. But I see no evidence that the media are more influenced in their news coverage and analysis by advertisers than was the case before. It may be so, but I do not have any evidence for it.

         : The fifth one, the anti-Communist filter, was too narrow. In our [2002] edition of

         , we expanded it to invented threats to try to control opinion and discussion. Iran is a good example; the war on terror is another. It is not just anti-Communism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Aside from that, I do not understand what is arbitrary. We looked at the institutional structures of the [mainstream] media. What are they? They are major corporations, that are often parts of bigger, mega-corporations. They have a product that they sell to a market. The product is readers of newspapers, or viewers on television, and the market is advertisers.
        </p>
        <p>
         So they are corporate institutions that sell readers to advertisers. They are all closely linked to government. There is a lot of flow, in and out, of personnel, with a lot of influence.
        </p>
        <p>
         And we asked a simple question, that anyone who believes in free markets would ask at once: Do the structure of the producer, of the market, and the links to other power structures, does that affect the media content? That is the propaganda model. There is nothing arbitrary about it. That is just elementary. And if you believe in free markets, that is exactly what you would look at.

         strategy. As they point out, Iran has very low military expenditure, even by the standards of the region, and, of course, by the standards of the West. Their strategic doctrine is defensive; they want to defend themselves from any attack. And if they are developing nuclear weapons, it would be part of their deterrent strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Who is that a threat to? It is very simple: It is a threat to the rogue states that want to rampage in the region without any deterrent. There are two of them. They are called the United States and Israel. It is a threat to them if anyone has a deterrent. That is the potential “threat” of Iran.
        </p>
        <p>
         Is there a way of dealing with that potential threat? There is one very simple way: move to establish a nuclear weapons–free zone in the area. Is there a barrier to that? Not from Iran. Iran has been calling for that for years. Not the Arab states, they have been pressing for it almost forever. In fact, they initiated the effort. Not the rest of the world, which is strongly in favor of it.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is one barrier. It is called the United States. The US, over a long period of time, has refused to allow this to proceed, most recently Obama in 2015. The US and Britain have a special commitment to this. Here is what ought to be the headlines on Iran: The United States and Britain have a particular commitment to a nuclear weapons–free zone in the region. When the US and Britain invaded Iraq, they had to concoct some sort of pretext. What they did was refer to a 1991 Security Council resolution that called on Saddam Hussein to stop his production of weapons of mass destruction. That very same Security Council resolution calls on “all parties,” meaning the US and Britain, to move towards establishing a nuclear weapons–free zone in the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         So the US and Britain have a special commitment to move towards the one measure that could end any possible threat that anyone believes Iran poses. Why aren’t they doing it? There is a simple reason. They have to prevent any inspection or control of Israel’s nuclear facilities. That is the story. Do you see it discussed? No. And I would give many other examples in a new edition.

         Well, there is an audience that is interesting. Let’s go back to the Sanders campaign that I mentioned earlier. The fact is that Sanders is by far the

         in the country. Journalism could try to respond to that. It could try to reach the people who are really interested in doing something about the hard problems of the world, and engage with them. There are plenty of such people. But the media are not reaching them. They can and they should. That would be the future of really independent media.
        </p>
        <p>
         Take something like
         <b>
          I.F. Stone’s Weekly
         </b>
         . One person working on his own was able to reach a large number of people. Furthermore, it was magnified by the fact that the professional, mainstream media pretended he did not exist, but the journalists were reading his stuff all the time and cannibalizing it. That could be done by the media themselves.

               Chomsky is perfectly happy with his “obscurity” because his goal as a gatekeeper is to influence a target market of intellectual and aware people.  It would be counter-productive for him to be on Mainstream Media because his goal is to neutralize Israel’s atrocities to those who will become aware of the situation, as opposed to the average person who won’t become aware of the situation and therefore doesn’t need neutralization.  If he was on Mainstream Media saying what he says presently to his target market, then the average person would become aware of all that Israel is doing, and that would be counterproductive to his goal of protecting Israel.  Dr. Chomsky the Gatekeeper is a traitor to his supporters, his supposed “ideals”, and to the US.

                   The only path to peace in Palestine is to wipe the slate clean and start over with an INDIGENOUS ONE-STATE with equal rights for ALL, including the RIGHT OF RETURN and REPARATIONS for Palestinians, not the fake two-state “solution” that Zionists like Finkelstein, Dershowitz, Netanyahu, Chomsky, Sanders and Amy Goodman push – that’s just continued slow-motion genocide of Palestinians.

                 I have my criticisms of Chomsky, but it’s completely unfair to call him a gatekeeper (unless you possess a definition of gatekeeper that I don’t use). No one stands up for the freedom to say what you want with more consistency than Noam Chomsky. If he intimidates people who disagree with him about something so that those people are too shy to speak up, that’s an entirely different thing and not something you can blame Noam Chomsky for. You can criticize him for perhaps not encouraging your search for 9/11 truth or (terrorist) JFK’s killers, but his failure, or perceived (by some) failure, to do the right thing here is not an example of gatekeeping.

                   Chomsky admits he’s a Zionist, says that Palestinians shouldn’t even ASK for the Right of Return, not even as a negotiating tactic, opposes withdrawal from Syria, threw cold water on BDS because it hurts Israel, the Homeland of the Jews, like Dershowitz supports the Two-State “Solution” which is continued genocide of Palestinians, and he’s a liar:

                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And yes, he supports the government narrative on JFK (see:  Jacob Leon Rubenstein) and on 9/11 (see:  Dancing Israelis).  You would think he would be immediately suspicious of the government narrative, but ultimately he’s in support of the Deep State because it supports Israel.  He is a moral monster.

             “Falsehood flies, and Truth comes limping after it.” Jonathon Swift, 1710. The falsehood begins with the U.S. Constitution, written by and for the Rich and their ownership of property. Consider that initially only property owners could vote. In Woodrow Wilson’s era it was give college to the wealthy and teach the rest to work in the factories. Our schools are basically brainwashing institutions, where the kids are trained to believe that the way this world is set up is the only way it could be I.E.: Capitalism is God.~~~~~All elections are purchased by vested interests, there is no such thing as an honest election. The Money talks and everything else is just B.S. Until people relearn how to think for them selves, I do not see much hope for change…….

             NC: “It [Republicans]  is the most dangerous organization in human history,…….”  The democrats are looking just as villainous from my perch .  The Democrats want people to drink their Kool-Aid, and Kool-aid is Kool-aid no matter what flavor.  What should be raising serious concerns by Noam is the blatant un-democratic, fascist censorship that is going on regarding vaccinations.  DEMOCRATIC Congressman Adam Schiff from the Republic of California gets Google, Facebook, Amazon, Pintrest, Instagram to deplatform any one who critical of vaccine products that Merck, Glaxo Smith Kline, Sanofi and Pfizer manufacture.  GOOGLE teams up with Glaxo Smith Kline

               Oh no….  Please take off the tin foil hat, and please send your children to Cuba to get vaccinated.  They have nearly perfect compliance and virtually zero vaccine preventable diseases.  Essentially the first thing any socialist movement does when it comes to power is make sure everyone is vaccinated. They aren’t brainwashed by Pharma or the capitalists.  Perhaps it’s just obvious science.

                 Vaccination may be a positive scientific innovation, but in the hands of greedy capitalists, it’s dangerous. Bundling (cost-cutting) vaccines introduces dangerous complexity. The use of thimerosal is criminal. Thimerosal contains mercury. And the attack on informed consent is frightening. Check out Robert Kennedy Junior’s website to get a good idea just what’s being foisted on the young population in regard to vaccinations. Along with sacrificing kids in imperial wars for the benefit of a parasitic minority, they are being experimented on with fake food (no precautionary principle) and in other ways. Check out Oliver Stone’s interesting reveal about Pokemon Go. Cell phones can cause cancer, we all know now. So what do the capitalists and their political assets do? They come up with 5G which is hundreds of times more powerful. Again, the precautionary principle is just in the way here. Profits are all that matters. And, by the way, they are now in the process of corrupting Cuba. The US-led Corporatocracy will allow ‘no’ dissent. All must worship the False Prophet and his system, or else.

             He loses me every time he brings up climate change as existential…….. Somehow this issue of DT pulling out of a mostly ceremonial accord while simultaneously reaching its goals relating to America’s decarbonizing efforts makes his admin the most dangerous in history.
             <br/>
             His argument doesn’t make any sense.
             <br/>
             China &amp; India are the largest contributors of CO2. There’s nothing the US could do without those two countries bringing thier carbon dioxide levels down to ours.
             <br/>
             I’m very disappointed in Noam for buying the hysteria. Equally disappointed in him for not being able to tell the difference between ACTUAL climate change progress and virtue signaling uselessness.

               Climate change IS an existential issue.  We’re reaching a point we’ve never seen in human history.  Outside of worldwide nuclear war, climate change will likely bring the biggest devastation to the human race.  Even with a sea change of efforts to reduce CO2 emissions (not forthcoming), we would still need to prepare for mass migrations, farming/food disruptions, dwindling water supplies in many places, etc.  We’ll likely see mass economic upheaval from those sectors alone (e.g. food, water, etc.).  Oceanside cities may be completely swallowed up.  And that bleak outlook is the best case scenario that INCLUDES systemic changes the current administration isn’t considering.  Without those efforts to reduce emissions, it’s anyone’s guess how much worse things will get.
              </p>
              <p>
               We’ve already crossed a threshold that will bring about huge changes, and we elected a guy who once wrote that climate change was a Chinese hoax.  I mean… we’re well past the point of action here, and the folks with real power aren’t sure whether there’s a problem.

             This is most disconcerting.  Walter Lippmann created the phrase “Manufacturing Consent” and Chomsky appropriated it.  Edward Bernays had another word for it, “Engineering Consent”.  Articles like this continue the myth, and Chomsky (who is smarter than all of us put together) knows this, but uses his undeserved street credibility in order to push his agenda – as a Zionist gatekeeper.
            </p>
            <p>
             Examples abound.  Among the most egregious, Noam Chomsky opposes the Palestinian’s Right of Return, going to the length of stating that Palestinians shouldn’t even ASK for it in negotiations!  Just forget about it.  Noam threw cold water on BDS, and shockingly enough, even lies about it:
             <a href="https://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/chomsky-bds-and-the-jewish-left-paradigm.html" rel="nofollow ugc">
              https://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/chomsky-bds-and-the-jewish-left-paradigm.html
             </a>
             .  Dr. Chomsky opposes withdrawing from Syria in service to Israel, al the while lying as to the situation: “Assad’s own objectives are to stay in power no matter how many Syrians he kills and how much damage he does to the country.”
             <a href="https://thewallwillfall.org/2015/01/03/conversation-with-noam-chomsky-on-syria-jay-tharappel/" rel="nofollow ugc">
              https://thewallwillfall.org/2015/01/03/conversation-with-noam-chomsky-on-syria-jay-tharappel/
             </a>
             .   His lie that he is concerned about the Kurds would be laughable if it wasn’t so insidious.  Most of all, like Dershowitz and off-and-on Netanyahu, he calls for a Two-State “Solution” which is clearly continued genocide of Palestinians.  On Democracy Now (Fall ’96, sorry for not having the exact link) he said of Hillary Clinton, a warmonger and MIC/AIPAC’s darling, “You’d have to be insane not to vote for Hillary Clinton.”﻿  So much for our battle against the Deep state.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has admitted that he’s a Zionist, and says, “I don’t consider myself to be a critic of Israel.  I consider myself to be a supporter of Israel.”
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCtYecGbQz8&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow ugc">

             (four minutes in).  His steadfast and determined effort to ensure that there are no further investigations into 9/11 may well be because he suspects or even knows for sure that Israel was involved (Dancing Israelis).  In the face of all reason, he insists on the official version of the Kennedy assassination!  Noam’s faith in a clearly false narrative by the government, something that one would think he would doubt instinctively from the get-go, strains credulity.  I suspect that he knows more than we do and he again is protecting the perpetrators (Wikipedia:  “Jack Ruby was born Jacob Leon Rubenstein,[6] on April 25, 1911, in the Maxwell Street area of Chicago as the son of Joseph Rubenstein and Fannie Turek Rutkowski (or Rokowsky), both Polish-born Orthodox Jews from Sokołów.”, something never discussed in the news.)  If Dr. Chomsky really cared about the US, he would endorse a Third Party candidate instead the likes of Hillary Clinton, but Noam Chomsky is an Israel-firster and as such supports the Deep State because it supports Israel.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is a sad day to see this on a FAIR website.  If you want to do an article on Chomsky, do one on how he normalizes Israel’s behavior by trotting it out and then offering no real solution – eventually, with real solution offered, it creates a ‘there’s nothing to be done’ attitude and will support Israel’s increasing and more egregious human atrocities; if need be, I’ll write the article but you certainly have the resources to do so.  (And, for the record, Democracy Now is being increasingly recognized as a Zionist gatekeeper, which is why they are so happy to have him on.)

               Well, Chomsky is ethnically Jewish.  As much as it makes no sense to have affinities for patches of dirt, we hominids are sentimental creatures.  Even brilliant apes are victims of human behavior/irrationality.

             “On social media, that has declined. People tend to go to things that just reinforce their own opinions, so you end up with bubbles. And it is all across the spectrum. The people on what is called the left see the left media, the people on the right see the right media. And the level of material is, of course, much more shallow.”
            </p>
            <p>
             That is an interesting comment and there’s something to it. “The Filter Bubble,” by Eli Pariser looks at all of that. (Then you look at Eli Pariser’s associates and the hair on your arm stands up.) However, there are other issues.
            </p>
            <p>
             Chomsky is brilliant and I’ve learned much from him (and have read many of his books and am still reading new ones by and about him). But he’s actually biased. I don’t think he cares much for the internet, although he predicted that special interests would seek to take it from the people. (As Yasha Levine points out, the people lost the internet in 1995, quietly. The people were allowed to use it, unmolested, for some time. But it was not to last.) Some alternative media is also found in print. Much alternative media is, simply, not different than mainstream media.  Even alternative / progressive media is not always solid. And it can be solid one day and then (like Democracy Now or Newsbud) totally establishment the next day. I see references to Chomsky now and then in alt/progressive media (which I scour regularly), but I don’t recall Chomsky paying any attention to those sources. (He’ll quote self-identified alternative media, like The Nation, but the Nation – and many other stalwarts like it – is pseudo progressive.) Usually the references in the alt/progressive media are positive. Not always. James Corbett (who I think usually does wonderful work) did an awful smear job on Noam Chomsky. Some criticisms of Chomsky I agree with. Kim Petersen’s take on Chomsky is good, in my view. Bottom line: Chomsky ignores much of the alternative / progressive media. Sure, Much of Chomsky’s research and writing took place before the internet – let alone many of the progressive orgs we see today – was a force. Still, Chomsky is still cranking it out and he has seen the rise of the internet and could have availed himself of all that that offered – if he wasn’t biased. It’s sort of like he has a love/hate relationship with major media and establishment scholarship. That might help explain how someone like Noam Chomsky could swallow the barrel bomb propaganda about Syria.
            </p>
            <p>
             No one, including myself, would argue that Chomsky should forget what he learned and ignore the NYT et al. But what if he’s ‘too’ caught up in establishment culture to see it perfectly clearly?

               Chomsky, like Amy Goodman, is a Zionist gatekeeper.  As such, he ultimately supports the Deep State because it supports Israel, The Homeland of the Jews, which is why he doesn’t actively promote third parties.  He has openly said that he is a Zionist.  And he’s a liar:

             Chomsky’s reportage on Syria is just awful. Nowhere is is bias for establishment media and against genuine alternative/progressive media so starkly on display and so very, very unproductive. To not give Eva Bartlett and Vanessa Beeley the credit they deserve for their coverage of Syria speaks volumes. FAIL!

           What’s FAIR
          </h4>
          <p>
           FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. We work to invigorate the First Amendment by advocating for greater diversity in the press and by scrutinizing media practices that marginalize public interest, minority and dissenting viewpoints. We expose neglected news stories and defend working journalists when they are muzzled. As a progressive group, we believe that structural reform is ultimately needed to break up the dominant media conglomerates, establish independent public broadcasting and promote strong non-profit sources of information.
