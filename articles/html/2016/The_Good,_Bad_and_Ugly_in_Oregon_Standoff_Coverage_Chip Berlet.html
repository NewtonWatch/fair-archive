         Unraveling the Gordian knot of media issues in the Oregon standoff between federal authorities and a Patriot/Militia alliance of building occupiers is a daunting task. Some journalists have written excellent, thoughtful articles, and some have wasted wood pulp and bandwidth. Most early reporting sat between those extremes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Patriot movement is the term used by many scholars to describe a collection of distinct submovements. Some recent reports make the false assumption that the white racism in the Patriot movement emerged from the South, and was then brought to the Pacific Northwest. This is partly true in the sense that the

          Ku Klux Klan

         , born in the South in the 1860s, later
         <a href="http://www.opb.org/radio/programs/thinkoutloud/segment/the-history-of-the-kkk-in-oregon/">
          flourished in Oregon in the 1920s
         </a>
         . There was also an American Nazi movement in Oregon.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Patriot movement, on the other hand, came to Oregon via California. The Patriot movement is based on a white supremacist and antisemitic conspiracy theory that solidified as a social movement called the Posse Comitatus. There are a number of well-researched books explaining how William Potter Gale in California developed the theory of the US government being seized by a secret cabal operating outside the “real” constitutional laws of the United States. This ideology forged the Posse Comitatus as a movement. In Oregon, Mike Beach started issuing an instruction booklet on how to form a local group.

         The rising aggressive militancy of the Patriot/Militia movement in Oregon has been a matter of discussion among progressive journalists, researchers, scholars and activists for many months. As a necessary disclosure, I have been part of that discussion and have done volunteer and paid research for some of the activist and research groups mentioned in this article. I have written about right-wing movements, civil liberties and government repression

         Published reporting predicting a coming confrontation in Oregon was online as early as July 2015 in a
         <a href="http://www.rop.org/patriot-movement-paramilitaries-in-oregon/">
          report
         </a>
         written by Spencer Sunshine of PRA  for Oregon’s

         </a>
         , a human rights group that has been targeted for intimidation by a coalition of militias, the 3 Percenters, Sovereign Citizens and Oath Keepers, all subgroups of the broader Patriot movement. According to Sunshine, the Patriot movement is a form of hard-right politics that exists between the right-wing Tea Party end of the Republican Party and the extreme-right white supremacist movement. Generally those in the Patriot movement view the current US federal government as an illegitimate state rapidly heading toward totalitarianism.

         In December 2015, PRA (

         ) ran an article by Doug Gilbert warning that the “Hard Right” in the US was “Being Bolstered by the Mainstream”:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Segments of the hard right are also acting in a context where their discourse continues to push into mainstream and is magnified around Donald Trump’s campaign trail. From making heinous comments about Latinos and immigrants, telling protesters to “go back to Africa,” retweeting neo-Nazi soundbites, declaring that all Muslims should be barred from the US, to proclaiming that Black Lives Matter demonstrators should have been “roughed up,” Trump has encouraged a new generation of white nationalists—much like David Duke did in the late 1980s.

        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Nearly 43 years ago, almost to the month, there was another major occupation against federal land theft out West. In this case, over 200 American Indian activists, Oglala Lakota as well as members of the American Indian Movement (AIM), took over Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in February 1973. Their

         This set the stage for Thompson’s “examination of that 1973 uprising,” which she suggests “illustrates very clearly not only that the occupation still unfolding in Oregon will not be ended easily, but also that its very raison d’etre is, at best, ironic,” since Native people argue the land was stolen from them in the first place.

         It’s easy to make fun of the Patriot/Militia movement. Some of their claims seem absurd: Obama is a Muslim and/or the Antichrist. Agenda 21 is a UN plot to control US land. Regulating guns is a prelude to black helicopters arriving with troops to impose tyranny.

They tend to be just like their neighbors. If, as a reporter, you are relying on social science—popular or scholarly—written before 1980, there is a good chance you may be relying on information that is outdated and in some cases has been refuted by sociologists using computer-based, data-driven analysis.

         The Patriot movement is heavily armed, and its supporters can be dangerous. They sometimes intimidate, threaten or assault people with whom they disagree. And they take over buildings or ranches and have standoffs with government authorities. This is not funny if you live in communities where the Patriot movement is active; especially if you work for the government, are a person of color, Mexican, Muslim, feminist, gay, a supporter of reproductive rights, etc.

         My wife and I spent 10 years living on the southwest side of Chicago involved in anti-racist organizing for racial equality and open housing against an anti-integration coalition of right-wing Patriots, the white-robed Ku Klux Klan, uniformed neo-Nazis and racist skinheads. A reference to this was included in the film
         <em>
          The Blues Brothers
         </em>
         , when Jake and Elwood Blues in their car force a neo-Nazi to jump off a small bridge into a stream. Jake says, “I hate Illinois Nazis.” I agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
         The scene was filmed in Chicago’s Jackson Park, but I walked across the actual bridge used by the Illinois Nazis in Marquette Park when I lived in that neighborhood in Chicago in the 1970s and 1980s. The film, one of my favorites, is hilariously funny. Less funny was that racist bullies, some of them armed, assaulted black people just walking in our neighborhood, and that there were fire bombings of our black neighbors’ homes.

         Our perception of personal and communal threat is shaped by the confluence of our existing biases, the biases of the media we consume, and the biases in language used by the federal government. As in the case of alleged Charleston shooter Dylann Roof, the “media and federal representatives rarely use the word ‘terrorism’ to describe” the violent actions of white right-wing militants, according to Naomi Braine, a sociologist at Brooklyn College. Braine writes in an article for Political Research Associates (

         The idea that the United States is heading for an economic or political collapse is widespread in the Patriot right, Christian right and white supremacist movements The result is a countersubversion panic. This fear-based narrative, which targets both rural and urban areas, is enhanced and exploited by survivalist supplies vendors, right-wing investment firms, and vendors of bulk gold and silver. Right-wing AM radio and internet demagogues push these themes and
         <a href="https://fair.org/extra-online-articles/alex-jones-and-the-informational-vacuum/" target="_blank">

         There is another reason to take the right-wing Patriot movement more seriously.

         In the 1990s, at the height of the armed Militia movement, politicians allied with right-wing populist movements were elected to public office, including Helen Chenoweth and Steve Stockman. Grassroots support for the Republican-led call for the

The Dies and McCarthy hearings inculcated a paranoid Cold War mentality while suppressing postwar union and civil rights activism. Segregationist intransigence caused federal troops to once again march South for federalism.

According to Lopez, “What led a militia to take over a federal building in Oregon? Behind the tense standoff is a legitimate protest over a troubling law.”
        </p>
        <p>
         No, that claim was a ruse, as was repeatedly pointed out by local citizens after their protest over the Hammonds being forced back to jail was used as a cover for seizing federal property by activists primarily from outside the state. Local folks have overwhelmingly signaled their lack of support for the building seizure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mandatory minimums are a rigid and heartless way to punish people. They recall the Dickensian legal system in England before religious social conscience movements forced reforms in criminal justice. Some writers who focused on mandatory minimums, though, seemed more concerned with finding a news peg using a subject familiar to them rather than digging deeper in their reporting on the Oregon standoff.

         ), Conor Friederdorf played the same hand without blushing, but added in the dubious claim that “in theory, those on the left who care about vanquishing mandatory minimums could have used the news story about the Hammonds to broaden awareness and opposition to the practice.” The subhead claims “Members of America’s political left share far more concerns in common with the armed protesters than many apparently realize.”
        </p>

         The fact is, advocates for reforms in the criminal justice system and for more humane prison conditions have been working together with folks in the religious right and other political tendencies for over a decade.

        <h3 class="western">
         US Government Treatment of Militant Protests and Standoffs
        </h3>
        <p>
         The Oregon standoff has a backstory that involves government policy toward standoffs and confrontations.
        </p>
        <p>
         A senior US Justice Department official during the 1993 standoff with the Branch Davidian religious sect outside Waco, Texas, recalls that there was conflicting advice on how to handle the situation. The Justice Department policy was being pulled in two opposite directions, according to the former official, who requested anonymity.
        </p>
        <p>
         On one side, hardliners inside and outside the government were urging that the Branch Davidians in the compound building be forced into submission through psychological warfare, including blaring loud rock music and flashing bright lights. This was accompanied by the compound being surrounded by a highly visible, heavily armed force of law enforcement agents.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the same time, the Justice Department was receiving phone calls from scholars of apocalyptic religious and political movements (including myself) warning that the approach being followed by law enforcement could create a dynamic of militant violence. Why? Because the Branch Davidians believed they were living in the End Times of Biblical prophecy. During this period, the Branch Davidians believed they would be tempted by Satan to renounce their loyalty to Jesus Christ. They came to believe that the federal government was allied with the Satanic End Times Antichrist system, and if they surrendered, they were literally surrendering their everlasting souls to eternal damnation. Far better to die as faithful Christians so their souls would be embraced by God in Heaven. That was their apocalyptic belief system.
        </p>
        <p>
         The violence was ultimately turned inward when a military tank was used to breach the walls of the main building. At least 76 people died in a conflagration. Later, 12 surviving members of the Branch Davidian sect were indicted for the unlawful possession of firearms and the deaths of federal law enforcement officers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Anger over the government response to the Branch Davidians, and to the standoffs with Randy Weaver and his family at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992, increased the size and militancy of the Patriot and armed Militia movements. Pushing these movements to insurgent rebellion was the purpose of the
         <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/oklahoma-city-bombing">
          bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building
         </a>
         in 1995. According to the senior Justice Department official, some experts affiliated with national human relations groups were so appalled by the bombing they were actually suggesting that the federal government should round up everyone in the armed militia movement—which would have created a huge civil liberties nightmare. Luckily, cooler heads prevailed inside the Justice Department.
        </p>
        <p>
         The standoff with the
         <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/1998/montana-freemen-trial-may-mark-end-era">
          Montana Freeman
         </a>
         in 1996 saw the implementation of a new Justice Department strategy of waiting out the occupants and negotiating for a peaceful settlement. This was a step forward, but federal policy now seems inconsistent and misguided.
        </p>
        <p>
         The failure of federal officials to indict scofflaw Bundy after the Nevada standoff was a serious policy error that may well have emboldened those who seized the federal building in Oregon. David Neiwert, an expert on right-wing movements, argued in a
         <strong>
          Washington Post
         </strong>
         column (
         <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/07/not-punishing-the-bundys-for-the-nevada-standoff-led-to-the-occupation-in-oregon/" target="_blank">
          1/7/16
         </a>
         ) that not punishing the Bundy family and its associates, who pointed loaded weapons at federal officers, helped lead to the Oregon occupation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The US government has failed to effectively deal with the consistent pattern of violence from within the Patriot/Militia movement. This confusion over policy has reignited a controversy over an earlier report issued by the US Department of Homeland Security on domestic threats. The headline in the
         <strong>
          New York Times

         </a>
         reads “Homeland Security Looked Past Antigovernment Movement, Ex-Analyst Says.” This happened in part because a Department of Homeland Security report was suppressed under pressure from the Republican Party and conservatives, a factor examined by the

         Violence is not caused by “extremism” or “radicalization.” This is an outdated concept. Many social scientists now argue that other factors such as humiliation, a compulsion to exact revenge or a need to be perceived as a hero are the important factors. Today the phrases “homegrown terrorism” and “violent radicalization” are often used to justify intrusive and abusive surveillance and political repression of suspect groups. Political centrists and law enforcement use these vague terms to demonize dissent on the left and right.

        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          We defend the right of people in the US to protest peacefully, no matter what the cause. We urge law enforcement to seek to de-escalate the situation in Oregon and seek a peaceful resolution.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unfortunately, elements of US law enforcement have a tragic history of over-reacting to protesters, responding with unnecessary force and violence.  The list is long: the crushing of anarchists and union workers at the dawn of the 20th century; the fire hoses turned on civil rights marchers, the infiltration and forceful removal of Occupy activists in cities across the country; and the militarized response to the Black Lives Matter movement.
         </p>
         <p>
          History reveals that government surveillance, disruption and repression overwhelmingly target activists on the political left. However, we do not condone seeking to level the playing field by mistreating those on the political right, as some have suggested. We urge that the government respect the right to protest of all people; and defuse confrontations with the absolute minimum of force required.

          Most mainstream news accounts of antigovernment protesters’ occupation of a Fish and Wildlife Service facility in Oregon have ignored or downplayed the group’s religious beliefs.

         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of the participants in the Nevada and Oregon standoffs are Mormons. There is no social science evidence that the Mormon church contains more conspiracy cranks or members of Patriot movement groups than any other religion in the United States. This is a fallacy of statistical analysis, based on the fact that a lot of the Patriot movement activists in the news lately are self-identified Mormons. They are also white and men. Most white men are not in the Patriot movement, although the movement is largely composed on white men.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many Patriot movement confrontations occur in the Rocky Mountain States, the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest, where there are also significant concentrations of Mormons. The connection works, however, when reporters point out that the single-most influential supplier of Patriot movement conspiracy theories nationally is media huckster Glenn Beck, who highlights his conversion to the Mormon faith.

          Beck gets many of his lurid conspiracy theories from the John Birch Society

         Finally, high-profile Christian Right Protestant conspiracy theorists outnumber Mormon conspiracy theorists in national public discourse. Leading the pack is author and Christian Right icon Tim LaHaye, whose fiction and “non-fiction” books warn of a vast federal government conspiracy to impose tyranny on behalf of Satan in the End Times prophesied in the Bible. This apocalyptic fear-mongering appears in the form of sign, and leaflets warning of the United Nations’ “Agenda 21,” the “New World Order” and federal “gun grabs.” Republican hopefuls Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are competing for support from the Christian Right, which makes up some 15 percent of the electorate in presidential elections—and is as a social movement the largest single organized ideological voting bloc in the Republican party.

         Republican Rhetoric and Patriot/Militia Movement Resurgence

         There is a dynamic relationship between the alarming rhetoric of the current crop of Republican presidential contenders and the resurgence of the Patriot/Militia movement, and it is fueled by a widespread belief in conspiracy theories. The Southern Poverty Law Center has issued two reports on the mainstreaming of conspiracy theories, one by Alexander Zaitchik (

         from the white supremacist movement. That most current members of the Patriot Movement do not seem to be aware of this fact is a sad commentary of the absorption of ideology without critical thinking. Back in the 1990s, there were Republicans elected to public office who echoed or even endorsed Patriot/Militia conspiracy theories—Rep. Helen Chenoweth (R.-Idaho) being a prime example. According to a

         Old Sociology vs. New Sociology

        <p>
         In a nutshell—no pun intended—the old sociology was that people who joined radical social movements on the left or right were addled dysfunctional misfits who played no serious role in mainstream politics, but primarily disrupted the ideal political center. Not so, say more recent social movement scholars in sociology. There is a dynamic relationship between social movements and the two mainstream political parties. When there is a large, angry and activist social movement outside the Democratic or Republican parties, electoral politicians move in the direction of the movement on their flank.

         a rising gap between the rich and poor, the middle class has been pressed out—“especially blue-collar men, the bottom of the middle.” With few other alternatives, they search for ways to restore their lost sense of honor and dignity. Hochschild feels their emotional need to reclaim a more respected place in society is the underlying crisis mobilizing Tea Party members into political action. And as they do this, they encounter resistance, in the form of criticism, disrespect and insult, from upper-middle class liberals and the mass media, who look down on them as “rednecks.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Folks who support the Tea Party and other right-wing populist movements are responding to rhetoric that honors them as the bedrock of American society. These are primarily middle-class and working-class white people with a deep sense of patriotism who bought into the American dream of upward mobility. Now they feel betrayed. They feel the government is allowing them to be shoved aside, displaced, dispossessed and disrespected by newcomers, outsiders, immigrants and other people they don’t see as proper citizens. Trump and his Republican allies appeal to their emotions by naming scapegoats to blame for their sense of being displaced by “outsiders” and abandoned by their government.

         Sociologist Rory McVeigh argues that shifting power dynamics that disrupt traditional hierarchies in economic, political and social power relationships launch the processes by which right-wing groups mobilize a mass base large enough to intrude into public debates in the larger society. Earlier social movement theories that were based on studying left-wing movements had much value in explaining the patterns and practices of right-wing movements, says McVeigh, but some theories, including Resource Mobilization and the Political Process Model, were less useful for the study of the right. These latter theories worked best when studying left-wing liberation movements and movements in which relatively oppressed groups are seeking equality.

         The late scholar Jean Hardisty, the founder of Political Research Associates, argued in 1995 that this situation resulted from a confluence of several historic factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          white racial resentment and bigotry;
         </li>
         <li>
          a conservative religious revitalization of the Christian Right;
         </li>
         <li>
          economic contraction and restructuring via “Free Market” neoliberalism;
         </li>
         <li>
          organized right-wing backlash movements–involving gender, race and class–generating widespread cleavages and social stress; and
         </li>
         <li>
          a network of foundation-funded national and grassroots right-wing organizations.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         “Each of these conditions has existed at previous times in US history,” wrote Hardisty. While they usually overlap to some extent, they also can be seen as distinct, identifiable phenomenon.” Hardisty concluded that “in this period they not only overlap, but reinforce each other. This mutual reinforcement accounts for the exceptional force of the current rightward swing.” I explained this in my recent article, “‘Trumping’ Democracy: Right-Wing Populism, Fascism and the Case for Action,” published in PRA’s magazine, the

         Law Enforcement Cover-Ups of Misconduct or Misfeasance
        </h3>
        <p>
         Some of the anger on the political right is shared on the political left and stems from the longstanding and growing political repression of dissent in the United States by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Repression often spawns coverups of official misconduct, which can occur when the targets are on the left, right or are non-ideological suspects. There is a long and tawdry tradition of the “

         While in Chicago, I helped start a legal newsletter on police misconduct that grew out of the corrupt practices of the city of Chicago police and the country sheriffs. Both were complicit in setting up the execution of radical activist and

         Federal authorities tried repeatedly to sweep under the rug their errors in handling the deadly raid on the Weaver family at Ruby Ridge and the disastrous handling of the Waco standoff. This incensed activists in the Patriot and Militia movements, and convinced Timothy McVeigh, a Patriot tuned neo-Nazi, to punish the government by bombing the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995.

         by sociology professor Stuart A. Wright, federal authorities mishandled a probe of a right-wing anti-federal criminal conspiracy prior to the Oklahoma City bombing, and then prematurely gave federal immunity to Michael Fortier, indicted in the bombing plot along with Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.

         Nichols told his trial attorneys that he was willing to name the other unindicted co-conspirators in the Oklahoma City bombing if the federal authorities would agree to shield him from the death penalty in the federal and state trials. The feds refused and Nichols, in prison for life, remains silent.

         Law enforcement cover-ups of misconduct or misfeasance increases the paranoid-sounding conspiracy theories on both the right and left. In addition, there is ample evidence of historic law enforcement collaboration with right-wing movements to target left-wing movements. This is detailed in two books by Frank Donner

         One problem of the 24-minute online news cycle is that too often the first content spotlights the unverified claims of the protagonists in an unfolding drama, which sets the dominant narrative in their favor. That’s what happened in the Oregon Standoff story. Early sympathy for the supposedly beleaguered heroic ranchers often was based on shallow, ahistorical reporting, as detailed in

         Between now and the 2016 presidential election, the role of the news media as the Fourth Estate will become increasingly crucial. The advertising budgets for the Republican and Democratic candidates will be huge. Serious reporting, including factchecking advertising claims, will help our buffeted ship of state through to a port where democracy and civil society are valued and have a safe and strong mooring.

             Exhaustive and appreciative, but a couple of things struck me by your writings. A small point, the Klan may well have controlled Ohio and Indiana’s governments in the early 20th century, but I think it’s just as important to have commented on their absolute saturation presence in the country, coast to coast at that time so as not to just narrow the focus of awareness of their presence in those days.  Maybe a minor point, but I caught the lack of appreciation of the Klan presence then.  Two, for all this exhaustive article, which I have only read 2/3, I admit, I am also struck by the lack of points describing how to alter these facts on the ground now and in the future.  Not offering any solutions or remedies after all that analysis is also quite striking.  It’s possible I missed this somewhere towards the middle of the piece. I will be re-reading this fully later on.  Thank you.

             On the first point, you are right. It would have been better to give more details of the widespread power of the KKK, in the 1920s especially.

             The notion that the outrage at Federal over reach is legitimate is conspicuously absent from this one sided report, as is any notion that the 2001 false flag was in fact more about the fake war on terror than any scary Muslims.

             Thank you for this excellent and thorough work, particularly including the cites.  I would like to hear more. While there are dramatic differences in belief systems and methods regarding the right and the left that are oppositional, there are common causes and experiences shared by the right and the left that bear some relationship to their respective levels of trust in government. For instance, back to the land movements are partially motivated by a survivalist mentality and the loss of collectivism. How can this kind of insight be turned turned into action and dialogue? How far off the mark is the fourth estate in this regard? As far as rural areas go, the gap between urban and rural existences has been a long interest of mine. Given the projected exponential rise of urbanism in the US and around the world, it is critical to understand the differences.

             Chip, you neglected to mention that you also had about 3 decades of experience as a gatekeeper and counterinsurgency specialist for the Ford Foundation, specializing in bullying progressive activists away from a critique of Wall Street and toward “identity politics.”

             Criticism from conspiracists about me are always welcome because they make my work more credible. Especially that I am “gatekeeper and counterinsurgency specialist for the Ford Foundation, specializing in bullying progressive activists away from a critique of Wall Street and toward ‘identity politics.’ ” Who knew?

             A well researched and documented article. Thanks for sharing the in-depth information. One item – where you state that “Jason Wilson in the British Guardian (1/14/16) nailed down the story better than most journalists in the United States when he wrote that the very real anger in rural Oregon
             <br/>
             will hardly be reduced by the circus that has attended the Bundys’ occupation, or the tendency to focus on their stunts, rather than the real pain this community has felt over decades. What are the kindnesses we can offer communities like Burns.” shows a completge misrepresentation of what is happening in Oregon. Few, if any of the participants are from the local community. In fact most of the locals want the Bundy Boys to get out of their town! These are outside activists that have been searching for a place to continue the 15 minutes of fame they had in 2014 in Nevada’s Bunkerville. And the self proclaimed “leader”  Ammon Bundy isn’t an aggrieved rancher. He got a $500,000 Government Guaranteed SBA loan to form a business in Arizona! Back to Cliven Bundy and his sons, he also isn’t a destitute local who hasn’t had opportunity. He has a lot of assets, a ranch of several hundred acres, and 600 – 800 head of catlle worth a Million Dollars, raised and fed on land that he doesn’t own and the leases on which were cancelled because he refused to abide by the rules that other ranchers follow. Bundy’s “community” has not suffered real pain, as the Virgin Valley region has boomed in the past 20 years. He is an Anarchist and Bigot of the highest order and deserves NO respect or sympathy. And he believes that he talks directly to God. Most of us consider that “delusional”.

             OREGON RANCHING CASE SPARKS ANTI-GOVERNMENT SENTIMENT
            </p>
            <p>
             Tags: DICTATORSHIPThe decision to again imprison the Hammonds has generated controversy in a rural part of the state. It’s also playing into a long-simmering conflict between ranchers and the U.S. government over the use of federal land.AP is not allowing comments or I would remind them that there is no federal land, it is PUBLIC land. The Enclave Clause in the Constitution forbids the Federal Government from owning land other than under Federal Buildings or federally built infrastructure such as airports, harbors, or military bases. The Federal Government is prohibited from simply grabbing a chunk of open range and declaring it to be their property!Read more: whatreallyhappened.com http://whatreallyhappened.com/#ixzz3wAcNLE5hhy bother replying to such a one sided report?

             Far from bolstering the arguments of those stating race is a non-issue in the context of the Oregon standoff, Waco and Ruby Ridge are more likely exceptions that prove the rule… it is extremely unusual that white right wing fanatics find themselves subjected to violence at the hands of civil authorities. #BlackLivesMatter has heightened awareness that the perceived race of a suspected wrongdoer makes a huge difference in how authorities react, yet there is another set of comparisons that may further inform our analysis.

             Sue Udry’s quote regarding authorities’ targeting of activists on the political left did not specifically mention the parallels and contrasts with EarthFirst! in the late 80s and 90s.  This March 1, 1994 article in High Country News
             <a href="http://www.hcn.org/issues/6/166" rel="nofollow">
              Earth First!ers experience Idaho-style justice
             </a>
             points to glaring disparities in treatment of the activists vs those opposing them. The following AP piece describes some of the broader issues of the time
             <br/>
             <a>
              ENVIRONMENTALISTS CONVERGE ON TIMBER MILL; 44 ARRESTED
             </a>
             EarthFirst! activists of the era typically limited engagements with their targets to sabotage and civil disobedience, yet they were often considered  terrorists by authorities and the media.
            </p>
            <p>
             Proclaiming anti-capitalist sentiments while directly challenging the status quo seems to be enough to provoke a disproportionate response from authorities. After all, it is difficult to imagine anyone would have thought bombing MOVE was reasonable if not for their their race *and* politics.  Compare the current standoff with a hypothetical scenario of EarthFirst!ers routinely brandishing firearms while taking direct action in defense of Mother Earth — would law enforcement be following the same script?

             Friday, January 15, 2016Why Unrest of Any Kind Defeats Both Versions of Americaby Anna Von ReitzThere has been a lot of inappropriate talk about “civil war” in America. Let’s be perfectly blunt.The Federal United States has been operated as a puppet by the British Government which in turn has been operated as a puppet by the City State of Westminster aka Inner City of London which has been operated by international banking cartels and the Bar for generations.In turn, these organizations have been influenced, led, and perpetuated by what Frank O’Collins calls “the Roman Cult” within the Roman Catholic Church.Americans, like the British People, have gone along trustingly and been abused and enslaved.We, Americans, have been used repeatedly as the “muscle” behind wars for profit and illegal and immoral police actions in other countries undertaken by the British Crown Corporation and its cronies throughout the world, with the result that we are widely blamed and despised as the perpetrators of all this greed and violence when in fact we have been victims like everyone else and have merely been more gullible than the rest of the world.A careful reading of the historical documents, especially the treaties ending the Revolutionary War and The Constitution, reveals that the British retained control of a substantial portion of the American jurisdiction of the sea including our ability to conclude international treaties and commercial trade agreements—both of which have been crippled and controlled since the birth of our nation by this arrangement.In exchange for our Forefather’s agreement to this deplorably bad deal, the British Monarch was made our Trustee on the High Seas and Navigable Inland Waterways.It was thought that his clear obligation to the Americans in this capacity would bind his hands and prevent him from doing us harm.In 1794 a treaty between the Americans and the City State of Westminster was also concluded in which we were promised “perpetual” friendship and amity.We definitely need to remind them of the meaning of “perpetual”.So here we are at the beginning of the twenty-first century and our Trustees have proven to be our worst enemies— not only our worst enemies, but worst enemies of all freedom-loving and decent people everywhere.Since 1866 the British Government has privately promoted and perpetuated a policy of eternal war and enslavement of the world’s population while keeping up an appearance of being the bulwark and defender of western civilization.Like a pedophile acting as a Foster Parent, the British Government has spared no expense in its efforts to cover up its dirty work, but it is at last discovered.The Federal United States is and has always been an instrumentality of the British Government and the international banks and the Bar Associations and it is the Federal United States—not the Continental United States— which has been guilty of all the crimes against humanity which have been racked up and placed at the door of the hapless Americans who have been deceived into believing that the Federal United States is or ever was their lawful government.Time to wake up.We have been hosts for these parasites and now they are moving on to attempt to parasitize China and its vast population.————–The so-called “Federal Government” is a foreign corporation under contract to provide our States with nineteen enumerated services directed by our Trustee the British Monarch and his corporate Executive Officer known as the “President of the United States”.————–

             For JjohninNV…During the presidential campaign Obama claimed he was a “Constitutional law professor” at the University of Chicago Law School, but this is not true. He was listed on the Chicago Law School website as a “Senior Lecturer in Law.” That is not the same as a law professor. http://www.westernjournalism.com/exclusive-investigative-reports/is-obama-stupid-and-lazy/

             I think part of the problem for most Americans on connecting dots to the current standoff in Oregon is their lack of awareness of the original 13th amendment….which was the law of the land from 1819 to time of the Civil War.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.amendment-13.org/Private" rel="nofollow ugc">
              http://www.amendment-13.org/Private
             </a>
             publications of the Constitution including the 13th Amendment are innumerable, having been printed as guides to the Constitution and the Law for the use of the common man in his education and understanding of the government of the nation, in which the general population was very much interested.Found in late March, 2006, a very high quality private publication published in 1855 before the start of the War Between The States, Echoes From The Cabinet, is unusual in having an onionskin insert showing facsimile signatures of the signers of the Declaration of Independence in addition to the Constitution with the 13th Titles of Nobility and Honour Amendment in place on page 38, opposite the frontise to the Declaration of Independence.

             This piece is way out of character for FAIR.  I’m not complaining, but I would like to make some comment.  It’s impossible to keep up with the sources Berlet cites.  I don’t know if we should appreciate him for having done the research for us, or regret him for embarrassing us.  I got that same feeling I did when I saw Melanie Griffith and Michael Douglas in Shining Through.  You could never put your finger on the story, but it gave you a feel for the nature of life under the inchoate Nazi regime.  Berlet makes a very important point when he links the crises in Waco and Ruby Ridge with the current one and the need for a peaceful resolution.  In 1993 I had been reading a lot of Niezsche, especially the Anti-Christ, and so was anti-Christian on principle then. So I watched with glee as the Davidian compound went up in flames.  Years later, I am deeply embarrassed about that, so I agree strongly with Berlet’s call for a peaceful resolution.  Still, I agree with Leo Horishny, “Not offering any solutions or remedies after all that analysis is also quite striking.”  Do we really have to do that much reading work and not be offered any solutions?  The only time the Feds make an overreach is in military spending and imperial war to protect multinational capital.  Why isn’t Aubrey John Debliquy moaning about those much more serious ills?  J O’Leary makes some very cogent additions that the issues of race and class are important components in these and similar stand offs.

             The underlying reason for the insurrection in Oregon is the prevalence of guns. While the media have yet to face it, all guns must be banned from private hands.

             Far more people die from prescription drug overdoses than guns…&amp; not to mention that over 23,000 bombs have dropped on 6 Muslim countries by gun grabber Obama. 2nd amendment is to protect us from tryants like him.

             Regarding your comment to JjohninNV subsequently directed to me: I too have no idea what you are rambling on about, and what’s at all intelligible displays alarming ignorance. If you are trying to say the Second Amendment allows us to rise up against our own government, you are remarkably uninformed, and I never have attempted to hid my opposition to guns in private hands.

             Private publications of the Constitution including the 13th Amendment are innumerable, having been printed as guides to the Constitution and the Law for the use of the common man in his education and understanding of the government of the nation, in which the general population was very much interested.Found in late March, 2006, a very high quality private publication published in 1855 before the start of the War Between The States, Echoes From The Cabinet, is unusual in having an onionskin insert showing facsimile signatures of the signers of the Declaration of Independence in addition to the Constitution with the 13th Titles of Nobility and Honour Amendment in place on page 38, opposite the frontise to the Declaration of Independence.

             The real jamokes are the federal law non-enforcement system. That they have done nothing to collect the millions Cliven Bundy has stolen from taxpayers nor anything to prosecute the multiple felonies by the armed thugs who threatened BLM personal reinforces the extensive evidence of a racist “justice” system.

             The Occupy movement was shut down by the militarized police, Black Lives Matters activists face the occupying army that are police forces have become, and black and Latin@ people are slaughtered in the streets with impunity.

             This is a country founded on genocide and slavery and white supremacy continues to be, functionally, the law of the land.

             @ Leland Roth: Your comment addressed to me says “Never mind the statistics that show gun controlled areas … like Chicago … have the highest gun violence around,” as an argument that “gun grabbers are usually the epitome of hypocrisy.” On the contrary, Chicago gun violence shows that private gun ownership should be outlawed.

             Private publications of the Constitution including the 13th Amendment are innumerable, having been printed as guides to the Constitution and the Law for the use of the common man in his education and understanding of the government of the nation, in which the general population was very much interested.

             @ Leland Roth: I really don’t want to pursue this further and encourage yet another rambling diatribe on this excellent website. Three points:
            </p>
            <p>
             1) Your comments are too long. As others have pointed out, this is really not a good place to publish your essays. You are taking advantage of your host’s commitment to free speech.
            </p>
            <p>
             2)  You refer to gun deaths rising after gun bans were enacted in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia. Obviously, guns were still available in these areas.
            </p>
            <p>
             3) To overthrow a government you need rifles and can’t do it with “smoothbore long barreled guns, pistols, revolvers, and other firearms, as well as Tasers”? What in heaven’s name are you talking about?

             Theories usually have a basis in fact, at least fact as some see it. In the case of the Patriots, I can imagine that the constant federal government testing of the Constitution gave rise to the theory of a cabal unconstitutionally running the country. Why can’t the government simply govern within the Constitution, why must it always be on the edge of lawful conduct and in many cases governing unlawfully? No wonder theories arise.

             is an oxy moron. You can tell its made up by the media because the word literally contradicts itself. No one claims to be apart of this movement. Its just a way for the media to make freedom loving people look evil. Its a smear campaign against real freedom. Sovereign means king whereas citizen means subject. Its literally an oxymoron. Contradiction and proof of propaganda in America.

               I also continue to follow the issues both here and in other venues. It is interesting to look back at the musings about how the Malheur occupation should end and compare them to how it actually DID end. I fully agreed with the concept that some of the blame for the Malheur Occupation is squarely on the shoulders of federal law enforcement policymakers  and “The failure of federal officials to indict scofflaw Bundy after the Nevada standoff was a serious policy error that may well have emboldened those who seized the federal building in Oregon”. Now that Bundy and several of his sons and other principles in both the Nevada and Oregon events are firmly behind bars, with many racing each other to plead guilty we can look back and reflect on what might have been different had swifter justice been meted out earlier. I expect that many more details about the inside operations will be revealed, especially about the Nevada Standoff. I still find myself unable to view these matters without seeing the common threads of religious extremism running throughout so many of our societal ills.

             HI Chip want to contact you and send a  copy of my book Windows Into the Soul. Please tell me where to send and give me an email address. Many thanks –Gary

             some info on the book:
             <br/>
             Dear Colleagues –given your interest in law, science, technology and society issues, I hope you won’t unduly mind this intrusion on your time.. I recently published Windows Into the Soul: Surveillance and Society in an Age of High Technology. The book culminates decades of thinking about civil rights, civil liberties, communication, protest, and technology questions since I was on the staff of the U.S. Kerner Commission and wrote Protest and Prejudice and Undercover Police Surveillance in America. Windows Into the Soul culminates decades of thinking about civil rights, civil liberties,

             communication, protest, social control and technology questions since I was on the staff of the U.S. Kerner Commission and wrote Protest and Prejudice and Undercover Police Surveillance in America.

             The book reflects the view that social science is best when it combines the empirical with the humanistic, the social with the technical, the cultural with material attributes and the law with ethics, and honors, but does not give up in, the face of complexity. The book confronts the frequent presence of haze and is drenched in the ironies, paradoxes, trade-offs, and value conflicts that so infuse contentious public issues of great import.

             It offers a systematic way to think about being watched and being a watcher. It goes beyond the usual government and big business suspects to also address surveillance as it involves families, friends and strangers. The book is organized around the “4 C’s of surveillance” –contracts, coercion, care and the cross-cutting issue of the private within the public. It is not above the occasional stoop to humor. Just because this stuff is deadly serious, that doesn’t mean it can’t sometimes be fun. The book is based on interviews, observation and the social science literature in the U.S., Europe and Asia, but also contains five satirical narratives that seek to convey the lived experience of being watched and a watcher. These deal with work monitoring, children, government, social science research and a free range voyeur. The book identifies a number of “techno-fallacies of the information age” and suggests a series of questions to be asked in assessing the ethics and wisdom of any effort to collect personal data. Several other chapters on surveillance in popular culture (music, ads, jokes) had to be cut, but are available on the webpage The press created for the book: (

           What’s FAIR
          </h4>
          <p>
           FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. We work to invigorate the First Amendment by advocating for greater diversity in the press and by scrutinizing media practices that marginalize public interest, minority and dissenting viewpoints. We expose neglected news stories and defend working journalists when they are muzzled. As a progressive group, we believe that structural reform is ultimately needed to break up the dominant media conglomerates, establish independent public broadcasting and promote strong non-profit sources of information.
