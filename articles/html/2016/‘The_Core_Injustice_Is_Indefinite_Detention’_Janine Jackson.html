         It was widely noted that Barack Obama’s last State of the Union address contained the same promise as his first, that he would move to close the military detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, now entering its 14th year. Media present closing Guantanamo as Obama’s quest, something he wants badly.  That he has struggled mightily to close the prison is one presumption.  The more striking one is that Guantanamo is, above all, Obama’s problem, rather than that of the hundreds of people who’ve been held there, or of a society aspiring to democracy that permits a prison that operates outside the law.

         I understand Beltway reporters’ tendency to report on Guantanamo Bay as about Barack Obama, you know: his legacy, his power. That’s not irrelevant, but there’s just so much else at stake.  Some of our listeners were in grade school when Guantanamo Bay opened.  Remind us why it opened; what was the supposed purpose in 2002?

         Sure. The Bush administration opened Guantanamo to create a prison that was beyond the reach of any law.  They explicitly chose it so that the US Constitution and other law would not apply.  In their minds, the nature of US control over that base meant that international law wouldn’t apply, Cuban law wouldn’t apply.  It was meant to be an area where they could use torture and other brutal interrogation tactics as they wanted, where they could hold people without charge, where they could conduct trials without basic due process protections.  It was meant mostly for that purpose and, in addition, to be far removed so that could easily be hidden from the conscience of most Americans, and out of sight, out of mind, in a place where they could bring whoever they wanted whenever they wanted for as long as they wanted.

         Well, that sounds dystopian.  And it’s amazing the degree to which it was kind of accepted, or has become normalized, at least, by US media.  A

          story
         </a>
         recently on five Yemeni men who were released to the United Arab Emirates just sort of reported none of the men had been charged with a crime, but they’d been detained as enemy combatants, you know, as though this were a kind of generally understood legal terminology and as though it made sense.
        </p>
        <p>
         So who was there, who is there still, in Guantanamo Bay? Who got caught up in it?

         So we currently, as of today, have 93 individuals left in Guantanamo.  Over the history of Guantanamo, 780 individuals have been held there.  All are Muslim men and boys.  Out of the 780, the vast majority have not been charged with any crime at all.  Most were cleared for release.  You have a lot of people, as the former US envoy for Guantanamo’s closure put it, that simply were not the worst of the worst but, a direct quote, “had the worst of luck.”  A lot of people that were brought over because the US was offering bounties in late 2001, early 2002, to local villagers who turned in anyone they suspected of militance, which obviously, for communities, meant people turning in anybody that they could make any kind of case.  You know, maybe they were not from that town, or they had a personal gripe with them.
        </p>
        <p>
         The US’s own numbers say that only 8 percent were ever Al Qaeda fighters.  There’s even a smaller percentage of numbers that the US actually claims were involved in any sort of combat.  And at the end of the day, you have more people that have died in Guantanamo than actually have been convicted by a court.  So that should give you some perspective, now that we commemorate the 14th anniversary of Guantanamo’s opening, 15 years for many men there, and we still have a reality where men continue to languish without charge, and many of whom have been cleared for release.

          took the
          <b>
           New York Times
          </b>
          to task
         </a>
         in 2009 for a story on a leaked Pentagon report which they headlined “One in Seven Freed Detainees Rejoins Fight, Report Finds.”  It was talking about former prisoners from Guantanamo “returning to terrorism or militant activity” when, as you’ve just explained, in many or most cases, they’ve not been shown to have been involved in any in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
         And yet for reporters, this image of Guantanamo as holding “the worst of the worst,” and we’ve seen politicians pick up on this, it had something to do with the fact that—and there were exceptions, folks like
         <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2013/miami-herald-reporter-covers-guantanamo-bay-for-12-years-with-no-end-in-sight/214562/">
          Carol Rosenberg
         </a>
         , who really did hard, independent work—but, in general, there was a reliance on the Pentagon as the source for any knowledge you were getting out of Guantanamo.  And that turned out not to be the best route to reliable information.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          OS:
         </b>
         That’s absolutely right. I mean, I think a lot of this has to do with Islamophobia and the reality that fearmongering has always been the primary justification for the ongoing detention of folks at Guantanamo Bay.  And I think those leaks also, if you sort of look at the timing, it’s always bureaucrats.  Usually the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, FBI, that have their own reasons for wanting Guantanamo open, who are selectively leaking, in many cases, inaccurate information. Or even if it has some accuracy in it, it’s being framed in a way to further the opportunistic politicians that want to bank on fearmongering as a way to either criticize President Obama or to scuttle efforts to close Guantanamo.
        </p>
        <p>
         So the way that that sort of reverberates in media and in political circles I think is deeply problematic, and those folks deserve a lot of the blame for Guantanamo still being open in 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          JJ:
         </b>
         It’s not that the obstacles aren’t real, but what can we say about Obama’s capacity to move the issue? Could he not do more?
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          OS:
         </b>
         Absolutely he can. I mean, it is very real that there are obstacles, both within his own administration and in Congress.  But at the same time, these obstacles emerged as a result of the fact that from the beginning, while President Obama did on his second day in office issue executive orders calling for the closure of Guantanamo, from the early days of that administration it was not followed up with a concrete plan of action and a set of steps to actually effectuate it.
        </p>
        <p>
         The way he went about the first year, and on into subsequent years, provided space for these obstacles to emerge.  And as soon as they emerged, they were the excuse for no action.  On his own, based on his own authority, he can release guys that are cleared for release.  I mean, we’re talking about out of the 93 detainees left, 34 of them are cleared for release.  Tomorrow  President Obama could put them on an airplane, send them away.  Of the remaining detainees, you have 49 of whom who are awaiting hearings by the periodic review boards that have been clearing the vast majority of detainees.
        </p>
        <p>
         If those review boards were expedited—and as president, Obama promised to do all hearings within a year—if he actually followed through with expediting that, you would have many more men cleared for release.  And if the military commission system, which has been fraught with abuses and serious due process violations, were once and for all done away with, and those that the US does suspect of criminal involvement were charged in federal courts, and the administration used a simple charge-or-release paradigm very familiar to prosecutors, he could on his own power close Guantanamo in a matter of days, not months or years.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          JJ:
         </b>
         It was interesting, in the State of the Union speech, that Obama said—and which many media credited him for revealing yet again his urge, his strong compulsion, to close Guantanamo—what he actually said is: “I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo.  It’s expensive, it’s unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Anytime a criticism of an abusive practice or policy begins with “it’s expensive,” you know, it’s not really inspiring.  It doesn’t really give you the feeling that the problem is the absence of due process, that the problem is putting people in a black hole of a prison that’s opaque to the public and that’s outside of the rule of law. His opposition, it doesn’t seem to be based on what some of us would call the right reasons.

         Right. The core injustice is indefinite detention; it’s this idea that you can have individuals who are now in their 15th  year of detention under US control, who the US government has said pose no threat, are cleared for release, who have never been charged with a crime, but yet wake up each day in Guantanamo and have no idea whether that will be the day that they’re released, whether they could die there, whether they’ll ever see their families again.  That core injustice—that’s not going to be solved by the reports of the president thinking about transferring Guantanamo to a federal prison in the United States.  That’s not closing Guantanamo; that’s merely changing its zip code and not addressing the core injustice.

             With so many crimes perpetrated by so many of the US financial, political and security elites, it is immeasurably sadder to have seen seven years of Obama inaction.  This still-open national gulag will share a place, alongside his creation of drone warfare as a primary vector of US “diplomacy,” in that sad brand-to-be:  The Obama Legacy.

             “For four months I was heavily tortured by the Army in Rio de Janeiro, and then in the Naval Information Center… Near death, I was taken to the hospital for the sixth time. The beatings had been so severe that my body was one big bruise. The blood clotted under my skin and all the hair on my body fell out. They pulled out all my fingernails. They poked needles through my sexual organs and used a rope to drag me across the floor by my testicles. Right afterwards they hung me upside down. They hung me handcuffed from a grating, removed my artificial leg, and tied my penis so l could not urinate. They forced me to stand on my one leg for three days without food or drink. They gave me so many drugs that my eardrums burst and I am impotent. They nailed my penis to a table for 24 hours. They tied me up like a pig and threw me into a pool so that I nearly drowned. They put me in a completely dark cell where I remained for 30 days urinating and defecating in the same place where I had to sleep. They fed me only bread soaked in water. They put me in a rubber box and turned on a siren. For three days I neither ate nor slept and I nearly went mad…” — Manuel de Conceicao, peasant leader in Brazil He was arrested in 1972 and brought before Brazilian security police who had been schooled at US army bases in the latest methods of counterinsurgency and interrogation. He was tortured by Brazilian army units — trained and equipped by US military-aid programs.A young Salvadoran deserted the Salvadoran army and fled to Mexico. His story was published in The Other Side magazine, 1982 Part of his training by eight American Green Berets consisted of “teaching how to torture.”He witnessed a boy of about fifteen, suspected of supporting the guerrillas, being subjected to a demonstration torture by the Green Berets They tore out the youth’s fingernails, broke his elbows, gouged out his eyes, and then burned him alive. The author reports that the torture sessions continued into the next day and included a thirteen year-old girl. Another victim had various parts of his body burned and was then taken up in a helicopter while still alive and thrown out at 14,000 feet. The defector noted that “often the army goes and throws people out over the sea.”(The editors of The Other Side withheld the Salvadoran informant’s name “for obvious reasons”but claimed that “the basic outline of his story has been corroborated by independent sources which we believe to be reliable.”)

The bombing became one of the most notorious atrocities of The Troubles, prompting a wave of sectarian revenge murders in its wake.Another reminder that acts of terror are hoaxes used by government to manipulate you!Share: Facebook Twitter Google Plus Myspace MSN Live Yahoo LinkedIn Orkut Digg Delicious» Permalink^Jan2608:15

The government plans to build a Jewish community, to be called Hiran, on the rubble of the homes of their fellow citizens in the Bedouin village of Um al Hiran. On August 23, bulldozers began the work. Nearby, the government plans to expand the Yatir forest to overrun the Bedouin village of Atir.Share: Facebook Twitter Google Plus Myspace MSN Live Yahoo LinkedIn Orkut Digg Delicious» Permalink^Jan2608:11

             GMO industry hacks and shills trying to claim that healthy eating is a ‘mental disorder’

             Tags: POLITICS/ELECTIONS/CORRUPTION SCIENCE/HEALTH/CLIMATE/NATUREWe live in an age of pseudo-illness, from obesity to ADHD. These “diseases” are cooked up in the imaginations of doctors and psychiatrists who attach a label to any arbitrary list of symptoms. In the latest gambit of intellectual chutzpah, scientists at the University of Northern Colorado claim that people with a passion for nutrition may be suffering from a mental disorder.The latest pseudo-disorder to take the academy by storm is called orthorexia nervosa (ON), which is characterized as “a pathologic obsession for bio-logically pure and healthy nutrition,” says Ryan M. Moroze, MD. In other words, if you strive to maintain healthy eating habits, according to these loons, you just might have a problem.(1)”Normal people love their GMOs and aspartame!” — Official White Horse SousePoll: Evangelicals flocking to TrumpTags: POLITICS/ELECTIONS/CORRUPTION RELIGION/ATHEISM WHITE HOUSEDonald Trump’s outreach to Christians is bearing fruit, if the results of the latest NBC News/Survey Monkey weekly online tracking poll out Tuesday are any indication.Among white evangelical Republican voters nationally, Trump earned the support of 37 percent, while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose father is a pastor and has played a key role in recruiting faith leaders to support his son, is at 20 percent. In the same survey conducted the previous week, Cruz registered 9 percentage points higher. Below the top two contenders, Ben Carson earned 11 percent among evangelicals, while Marco Rubio took 10 percent.Share: Facebook Twitter Google Plus Myspace MSN Live Yahoo LinkedIn Orkut Digg Delicious» Permalink^Jan2608:04

             Drug shortages in American emergency rooms have increased more than 400 percent
            </p>
            <p>
             Tags: SCIENCE/HEALTH/CLIMATE/NATUREEmergency rooms are health care’s front line – in the United States, nearly 45 out of 100 people visit an ER in any given year. But there’s an issue brewing behind the scenes in emergency medical facilities, one that can’t be fixed by a simple stitch or bandage. A new study published in the journal Academic Emergency Medicine shows that drug shortages in ERs across the United States increased by more than 400 percent between 2001 and 2014.The study analyzed data from the University of Utah Drug Information Service, which receives drug shortage reports submitted through a public site administered by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Two practicing emergency room physicians assessed whether the reported shortages had to do with drugs used in ERs, then looked at whether they were associated with lifesaving or acute conditions.Share: Facebook Twitter Google Plus Myspace MSN Live Yahoo LinkedIn Orkut Digg Delicious» Permalink^Jan2608:02

             By: Stacy VassmanTags: RUSSIA/UKRAINEMoscow considers that signing a peace treaty with Tokyo is not synonymous with solving the long-running territorial dispute, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at the annual press conference on Tuesday.Japan says third countries’ participation in developing Southern Kurils ‘unacceptable’: Japan’s Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida has shown discontent over Moscow’s invitation for foreign partners to join fisheries projects in the Southern Kuril Islands if Tokyo turns down the proposal. The Japanese foreign minister also underlined the need to resolve the territorial dispute. “That’s why this year we would like to necessary achieve progress in the Japanese-Russian relations.” Japan refuses to participate in the economic projects on the Kuril Islands and does not recommend its citizens to visit them saying that the necessary completion of the Russian documents confirms Moscow’s sovereignty over the Southern Kurils. http://tass.ru/en/world/852106Jan2607:53

             Russia supplied arms to Iraqi Kurds through official Baghdad — Lavrov

            <p>
             By: Stacy VassmanTags: RUSSIA/UKRAINEAccording to him, practically as soon as the terrorist threat emerged, when supplying arms to Iraq, Russia took into account the fact that both the government army and the Kurdish militias were fighting against the Islamic State terrorists . “We took into account the Kurds’ needs in the supplies of our arms to Iraq, but these supplies were made through the central government, through Baghdad,” the minister said. “We fully respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.” The foreign minister also dwelled on the role of Syrian Kurds in the settlement of the Syrian conflict. The minister noted that the decision on the Kurds participation in the inter-Syrian talks should be taken by United Nations Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura and Russia will not veto it. “It will be the most serious mistake not to invite Kurds (for inter-Syrian talks), but we will not impose any veto,” Lavrov said.Jan2607:39

             Tags: DICTATORSHIP EDUCATIONParents, beware — Big Brother is coming for your kids. Buried deep inside the mammoth “bipartisan” so-called “education” legislation approved last month, dubbed the “Every Student Succeeds Act” (ESSA), is a radical expansion of what the statute refers to as “full-service community schools.” The controversial institutions, more accurately described as parental replacement centers, seek to oversee every aspect of your child’s life, ranging from their “mental health” and “well being” to nutrition and even dentistry. You are in the crosshairs, too, as the Obama administration defines parents as “equal partners” in child rearing. And those are just some of the many unconstitutional provisions in the bill and beyond that aim to turn government schools into parents, and parents into pariahs.Share: Facebook Twitter Google Plus Myspace MSN Live Yahoo LinkedIn Orkut Digg Delicious» Permalink^Jan2515:20

           What’s FAIR
          </h4>
          <p>
           FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. We work to invigorate the First Amendment by advocating for greater diversity in the press and by scrutinizing media practices that marginalize public interest, minority and dissenting viewpoints. We expose neglected news stories and defend working journalists when they are muzzled. As a progressive group, we believe that structural reform is ultimately needed to break up the dominant media conglomerates, establish independent public broadcasting and promote strong non-profit sources of information.
