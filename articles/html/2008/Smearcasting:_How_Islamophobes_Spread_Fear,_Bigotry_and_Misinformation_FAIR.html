        <h2>
         Making Islamophobia Mainstream
        </h2>
        <h3>
         How Muslim-bashers broadcast their bigotry
        </h3>
        <p>
         A remarkable thing happened at the National Book Critics Circle (NBCC) nominations in February 2007: The normally highbrow and tolerant group nominated for best book in the field of criticism a book widely viewed as denigrating an entire religious group.
        </p>
        <p>
         The nomination of Bruce Bawer’s
         <em>
          While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam Is Destroying the West From Within
         </em>
         didn’t pass without controversy. Past nominee Eliot Weinberger denounced the book at the NBCC’s annual gathering, calling it ‘‘racism as criticism’’ (
         <strong>
          New York Times
         </strong>
         , 2/8/07). NBCC board president John Freeman wrote on the group’s blog (
         <strong>
          Critical Mass
         </strong>
         , 2/4/07): ‘‘I have never been more embarrassed by a choice than I have been with Bruce Bawer’s
         <em>
          While Europe Slept
         </em>
         …. Its hyperventilated rhetoric tips from actual critique into Islamophobia.’’
        </p>
        <p>
         Though it didn’t ultimately win the award,
         <em>
          While Europe Slept
         </em>
         ’s recognition in the highest literary circles was emblematic of a mainstreaming of Islamophobia, not just in American publishing but in the broader media.

         -the-scenes connections that are rarely explored in media. The report also provides four snapshots, or “case studies,” describing how Islamophobes continue to manipulate media to in order to paint Muslims with a broad, hateful brush. Our aim is to document smearcasting: the public writings and appearances of Islamophobic activists and pundits who intentionally and regularly spread fear, bigotry and misinformation.

         The term “Islamophobia” refers to hostility toward Islam and Muslims that tends to dehumanize an entire faith, portraying it as fundamentally alien and attributing to it an inherent, essential set of negative traits such as irrationality, intolerance and violence. And not unlike the charges made in the classical document of anti-Semitism,
         <em>
          The Protocols of the Elders of Zion
         </em>
         , some of Islamophobia’s more virulent expressions—like
         <em>
          While Europe Slept
         </em>
         —include evocations of Islamic designs to dominate the West.
        </p>
        <p>
         Islamic institutions and Muslims, of course, should be subject to the same kind of scrutiny and criticism as anyone else. For instance, when a Norwegian Islamic Council debates whether gay men and lesbians should be executed, one may forcefully condemn individuals or groups sharing that opinion without pulling all European Muslims into it, as did Bawer’s
         <strong>
          Pajamas Media
         </strong>
         post (8/7/08), “European Muslims Debate: Should Gays Be Executed?”
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, extremists who justify their violent actions by invoking some particular interpretation of Islam can be criticized without implicating the enormously diverse population of Muslims around the world. After all, reporters managed to cover the Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh—an adherent of the racist Christian Identity sect—without resorting to generalized statements about “Christian terrorism.” Likewise, media have covered acts of terrorism by fanatics who are Jewish—for instance, the Hebron massacre carried out by Baruch Goldstein (
         <strong>
          Extra!
         </strong>
         , 5–6/94)—without implicating the entirety of Judaism.
        </p>
        <p>
         In works such as Orientalism and Covering Islam, cultural analyst Edward Said criticized an ideology that he argued treated peoples of the Middle East and Asia, particularly Muslims, as the “other”—inherently different from and inferior to the people of “the West.” It’s not hard to find support for his thesis in U.S. establishment journalism.

        <p>
         Why is it necessary to invoke cultural stereotypes to explain why you won’t accept an envelope full of cash after mercenaries kill your child? Or to explain quite normal opposition to being bombed, detained or aggressively searched? Because the widespread assumption in the U.S. media is that people in Iraq and Afghanistan, and elsewhere in the Muslim world, are fundamentally unlike Americans.

         There are many varieties of Muslim-bashing on display in the media. One strain holds that Islam is inherently evil or violent—a “bloody, brutal type of religion,” as televangelist Pat Robertson put it (
         <strong>
          700 Club
         </strong>
         , 4/28/06). Robert Spencer, who has authored two New York Times best sellers on Islam, puts a scholarly face on Islamophobia, arguing that (
         <strong>
          Empty Wheel
         </strong>
         , 2/21/07) “jihad as warfare against nonbelievers in order to institute ‘Sharia’ worldwide…is a constant element of mainstream Islamic theology.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Islamophobes like Sean Hannity dwell on “the silence of moderate Muslims,” whom Hannity (

         , 7/13/07) says are insufficiently “critical against those that would hijack their religion”—placing a burden on Muslims to take responsibility for extremist fringe elements of their religion that is not likewise applied to Christians. Also exemplifying this form of Islamophobia is
         <strong>
          CNN Headline News
         </strong>
         host Glenn Beck, who said to Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the first Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress (
         <strong>
          Glenn Beck
         </strong>
         , 11/14/06), “Sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies,” and on his syndicated radio show warned (
         <strong>
          Glenn Beck Program
         </strong>
         , 8/10/06):
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          All you Muslims who have sat on your frickin’ hands the whole time and have not been marching in the streets and have not been saying, ‘Hey, you know what? There are good Muslims and bad Muslims. We need to be the first ones in the recruitment office lining up to shoot the bad Muslims in the head.’ I’m telling you, with God as my witness…human beings are not strong enough, unfortunately, to restrain themselves from putting up razor wire and putting you on one side of it.

        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Another category of Islamophobia finds militant Muslims lurking around every corner and paints them as an existential threat to the U.S. and its allies. The documentary
         <em>
          Obsession: Radical Islam’s War Against the West
         </em>
         (2006), which has been a mainstay of David Horowitz’s “Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week” (see the sidebar “Islamofascism”), describes “radical Islam” as a menace comparable to Adolf Hitler that, according to the film’s website, “is threatening, with all the means at its disposal, to bow Western civilization under the yoke of its values.” Meanwhile, Daniel Pipes has warned of an Islamic threat to America posed by Muslim groups ranging from the college campus-based Muslim Student Associations to secular groups like the Arab Anti-Defamation League (see
         <strong>
          Inter-Press Service
         </strong>
         , 2/24/05). Pipes (

         Some strains of Muslim-bashing share a good deal in common with the racist pseudo-science of eugenics—most notably Mark Steyn’s writings about the “demographic decline” manifest in Europe’s growing Muslim population. Pipes struck a similar note with his warnings (
         <strong>
          National Review
         </strong>
         , 11/19/90) that “Western societies are unprepared for the massive immigration of brown-skinned peoples cooking strange foods and maintaining different standards of hygiene” and that “Muslim customs are more troublesome than most.”
        </p>
        <p>
         This range of anti-Muslim views finds a vehicle in a range of online, radio and print outlets. Some of the harshest Muslim-bashing can be found in the right-wing blogosphere (

         <strong>
          Savage Nation
         </strong>
         , 7/2/07), “When I see a woman walking around with a burqa, I see… a hateful Nazi who would like to cut your throat and kill your children.”
        </p>
        <p>
         At the same time, lengthy treatises that attempt to put a more scholarly facade on Islamophobia provide fuel for those fires. In addition to Bawer’s book, recent years have seen publishers like
         <strong>
          Regnery
         </strong>
         unleashing a number of successful books that are inarguably Islamophobic: Mark Steyn’s

         bestseller
         <em>

         (2004), which have thrived in the U.S. book market.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Islamophobia generated in these backwaters finds its way into the mainstream, accessing a national platform and audience through such tributaries as the cable TV and radio shows hosted by
         <strong>
          Fox News
         </strong>
         ’ Sean Hannity and
         <strong>
          CNN Headline News
         </strong>
         ’ Glenn Beck. Islamophobic ideas get important institutional support through conservative newspapers such as the
         <strong>
          New York Sun
         </strong>
         and
         <strong>
          New York Post
         </strong>
         , both of which regularly publish Pipes’ columns, and many more centrist papers carry Michelle Malkin’s nationally syndicated column.
        </p>
        <p>
         Together, these Muslim-bashing outlets and pundits constitute what is, in effect, a network. Funded by the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, a prominent right-wing foundation, Daniel Pipes’ Middle East Forum is connected to a range of other right-wing think tanks; its editors and editorial board include representatives from the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Pipes’ Campus Watch and Robert Spencer’s Jihad Watch operate out of David Horowitz’s Freedom Center.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prominent members of this network also have official connections; Pipes, for instance, was appointed by George W. Bush to the board of the U.S. Institute of Peace in 2003.
        </p>
        <p>
         Muslim-bashers often have much more certainty than expertise, as exemplified by Alan Dershowitz (
         <strong>
          Boston Globe
         </strong>
         , 6/5/08), who traced “the beginning of Islamic terrorism in America” to the assassination of Robert Kennedy by Sirhan Sirhan—a Palestinian Christian. But whether their fears are reality-based or not, Islamophobia is a force to be reckoned with.

        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          The point here is that there are 150 Muslim students’ associations, which are coddled by university administrations and treated as though they were ethnic or religious groups, when they are political groups that are arms of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is the fountainhead of the terrorist jihad against the West.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         No doubt the students are part of the “between 150 million and 750 million Muslims” Horowitz claims “support a holy war against Christians, Jews and other Muslims” (

         <p>
          Of course, the devil can quote scripture for his own purpose, but Osama’s use of these and other passages in his messages is consistent (as we shall see) with traditional understanding of the Quran. When modern-day Jews and Christians read their Bibles, they simply don’t interpret the passages cited as exhorting them to violent actions against unbelievers. This is due to the influence of centuries of interpretative traditions that have moved them away from literalism regarding these passages. But in Islam, there is no comparable interpretative tradition.

         Yet Islam does in fact have an interpretive tradition, which Spencer seems bent on ignoring. His

        </p>
        <p>
         According to
         <strong>
          Crane
         </strong>
         , “Spencer’s readers are carefully steered away from all contact with the Islamic interpretative tradition, which equals or exceeds that of any other religion, because any scholarly knowledge about Islam would expose all his extremist interpretations to ridicule.”
        </p>
        <p>
         By selectively ignoring inconvenient Islamic texts and commentaries, Spencer (
         <strong>

         , 3/3/07) concludes that Islam is innately extremist and violent, and,

        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Unfortunately, however, jihad as warfare against non-believers in order to institute “Sharia” worldwide is not propaganda or ignorance, or a heretical doctrine held by a tiny minority of extremists. Instead, it is a constant element of mainstream Islamic theology.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Of course, a similarly selective reading of the Torah might lead one to conclude that Jews favor killing homosexuals, as well as those who wear garments that mix cotton and wool. Spencer’s methods have prompted even conservatives such as Dinesh D’Souza (who challenged his views on Islam in a

        <p>
         But those methods have made Spencer a mainstay in the Islamophobia circuit, featured, for example, at Horowitz’s 2007 Islamofascism Awareness events. And they haven’t decreased his popularity in official circles: His website boasts that he has led seminars on Islam and jihad for, among others, the U.S. Central Command, the Department of Homeland Security, the Joint Terrorism Task Force and “the U.S. intelligence community.”

         Michael Savage
        </h3>
        <p>
         If Daniel Pipes and Robert Spencer serve the movement by providing intellectual arguments for its rank and file, Michael Savage serves as its angry rabble-rouser. And Savage’s reach is remarkable: His radio show
         <strong>
          Savage Nation
         </strong>
         reaches a reported 8.25 million listeners per week (
         <strong>
          Talkers Magazine
         </strong>
         , Spring/08), the third most popular political talk radio show in the country (trailing only Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity).
        </p>
        <p>
         Savage is notorious for his relentlessly hateful language—he was fired from his
         <strong>
          MSNBC
         </strong>
         gig when he labeled a caller a “sodomite” and told him to “get AIDS and die” (
         <strong>
          FAIR
         </strong>
         Action Alert, 7/7/03)—and Muslims are often his target. “When I see a woman walking around with a burqa,” Savage told his listeners on July 2, 2007, “I see a Nazi… a hateful Nazi who would like to cut your throat and kill your children.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Savage sees a monolithic Islamic scheme to take over the U.S.—“We know you want to take over America. We know you wanna push your religion down everyone’s throat,” (
         <strong>
          Savage Nation
         </strong>
         , 7/2/07), and imagines himself one of the few brave souls standing up against the onslaught (10/29/07): “I’m not gonna put my wife in a hijab. And I’m not gonna put my daughter in a burqa. And I’m not getting on my all-fours and braying to Mecca…. I don’t wanna hear anymore about Islam. Take your religion and shove it up your behind.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Savage has even called (4/17/06) for killing a hundred million Muslims, saying that
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          people are very depressed by the weakness that America is showing to these psychotics in the Muslim world. They say, “Oh, there’s a billion of them.” I said, “So, kill 100 million of them, then there’ll be 900 million of them.” I mean, would you rather die—would you rather us die than them? I mean, what is it going to take for you people to wake up? Would you rather we disappear or we die? Or would you rather they disappear and they die? Because you’re going to have to make that choice sooner rather than later.

At the same time, he claims Islam is a “bloody, brutal type of religion” (4/28/06) whose followers only “deal with history and the truth with violence” and “don’t understand what reasoned dialogue is” (9/25/06).
        </p>
        <p>
         When cartoons that portrayed Muhammad negatively sparked protest among Muslims, Robertson announced (3/13/06): “These people are crazed fanatics, and I want to say it now: I believe it’s motivated by demonic power. It is satanic and it’s time we recognize what we’re dealing with.”

         Robertson is not ranting that his enemies are possessed by demons on a street corner; his soapbox is a world-wide television network reaching 200 countries, and a show (

        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          The U.S. should bomb the Afghan infrastructure to rubble—the airport, the power plants, their water facilities and the roads…. This is a very primitive country. And taking out their ability to exist day to day will not be hard…. If they don’t rise up against thiscriminal government, they starve, period.
         </p>

         Also on his list were Iraq (“Their infrastructure must be destroyed and the population made to endure yet another round of intense pain”) and Libya (“Nothing goes in, nothing goes out…. Let them eat sand”).

        <p>
         This enthusiasm he has expressed for attacking countries with Muslim populations is an O’Reilly trademark (e.g.,

        <blockquote>

        <h2>
         Islamofascism:
        </h2>
        <h3>
         A fringe term goes mainstream, with a little help from the media
        </h3>
        <p>
         The term “Islamofascism” came into common use after the September 2001 attacks as a favorite way for neoconservatives to describe the ideology of extremist and violent groups such as Al-Qaeda that claim to act in the name of Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
         A search of the Nexis database shows just two mentions of the term before 2001, both in British media. The first (
         <strong>
          Independent
         </strong>
         , 9/8/90) came in a remark by writer Malise Ruthven about governments in predominantly Islamic countries: “Authoritarian government, not to say ‘Islamo-fascism,’ is the rule rather than the exception from Morocco to Pakistan.” (Ironically, considering the term’s current usage, most of these authoritarian governments—including Morocco and Pakistan—were backed by the U.S. at the time.) The second mention (
         <strong>
          Independent
         </strong>
         , 10/6/90) came in a response criticizing Ruthven for coining the term.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 2001, use of the expression has exploded. That year, according to a search of major English language papers in the Nexis database, the word and its variant “Islamofascist” appeared 12 times, nearly all in reference to Al-Qaeda. The next year that number rose to 69, and it reached 92 in 2003 as the word’s definition began expanding to include Saddam Hussein’s historically non-religious and somewhat ecumenical Baathist regime. (As an example, Tariq Aziz, Hussein’s familiar spokesperson, was a Christian.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The word’s prevalence continued to increase in 2005, the year George W. Bush used it in a speech to the National Endowment for Democracy (10/6/05), and in 2006 it appeared 594 times in major papers. David Horowitz’s “Islamofascism Awareness Week” (IFAW)—organized on about a hundred college campuses in October 2007—was a sign that the term had fully arrived in some right-wing circles, though not all conservatives seemed to entirely understand the message it is supposed to convey. At Michigan State University, the campus chapter of Young Americans for Freedom invited a bona fide fascist—Nick Griffin, the head of the racist British National Party—to speak on how Europe is becoming “Eurabia” (

         William Safire, former op-ed columnist and current “On Language” columnist, wrote (10/1/06), “Islamofascism may have legs: The compound defines those terrorists who profess a religious mission while embracing totalitarian methods and helps separate them from devout Muslims who want no part of terrorist means.”

         But the term does precisely the opposite, say critics, linking an entire religion to the violent and intolerant actions of a minority claiming to act in its name.

         Many scholars dismiss “Islamofascism” as little more than a political slogan that “War on Terror” proponents use to play on emotions by invoking odious historical enemies. As former Clinton security advisor and Center for Strategic and International Studies fellow Daniel Benjamin put it in a

        <blockquote>
         <p>
          There is no sense in which jihadists embrace fascist ideology as it was developed by Mussolini or anyone else who was associated with the term….This is an epithet, a way of arousing strong emotion and tarnishing one’s opponent, but it doesn’t tell us anything about the content of their beliefs.

         Niall Ferguson, the right-leaning Harvard historian, points out the term’s role in Western propagandizing against the latest enemies in the large and disparate Islamic world. According to Ferguson (Interviewed for Institute of International Studies, UC Berkeley’s “Conversations with History” series, 10/19/06), Islamofascism is
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          a completely misleading concept. In fact, there’s virtually no overlap between the ideology of Al Qaeda and fascism. It’s just a way of making us feel that we’re the “greatest generation” fighting another World War, like the war our fathers and grandfathers fought. You’re translating a crisis symbolized by 9/11 into a sort of pseudo-World War II. So 9/11 becomes Pearl Harbor, and then you go after the bad guys who are the fascists, and if you don’t support us, then you must be an appeaser.

         As the term has been increasingly criticized, its use in the media has dropped, with 328 occurrences in 2007 and a pace that will barely break 200 so far in 2008. In April 2008, the White House thought better of the term, deciding it would no longer use it, along with “Jihadist” and other similar expressions. The administration explained (
         <strong>
          Associated Press
         </strong>
         , 4/24/08), “Such words may actually boost support for radicals among Arab and Muslim audiences by giving them a veneer of religious credibility or by causing offense to moderates.”
        </p>
        <p>
         All true, but there is also the problem of double standards—a theme that runs deep in any investigation of Islamophobia.
         <strong>
          Boston Globe
         </strong>
         columnist James Carrol put it well in a column about politicians using the term (1/21/08):
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          The pairing of “Islam” and “fascism” has no parallel in characterizations of extremisms tied to other religions, although the defining movements of fascismwere linked to Catholicism—indirectly under Benito Mussolini in Italy, explicitly under Francisco Franco in Spain. Protestant and Catholic terrorists in Northern Ireland, both deserving the label “fascist,” never had their religions prefixed to thatword. Nor have Hindu extremists in India, nor Buddhist extremists in Sri Lanka.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Carrol adds, “The point is that there is a deep religious prejudice at work, and when politicians adopt its code, they make it worse.” Journalists would do well to heed these words as well.

         Daniel Pipes’ Witch Hunt at a Public School
        </h2>

         In September 2007, the Khalil Gibran International Academy, named for the noted Lebanese Christian poet, became the country’s first public school focused on Arabic language and culture. According to the New York Department of Education (
         <strong>

         , 7/30/07) the school was using “the same curriculum packages as other New York City public schools,” and the chancellor of schools emphasized (
         <strong>
          Christian Science Monitor
         </strong>
         , 6/1/07) that its curriculum would be subject to departmental monitoring as with any other public school. In short, according to New York schools chancellor Joel Klein, it was not so different from the 60-plus other dual language schools already operating in New York. However, months before it opened its doors in Brooklyn, N.Y. the school came under fire from detractors who preemptively accused it of “imbuing pan-Arabism and anti-Zionism, proselytizing for Islam, and promoting Islamist sympathies” (
         <strong>
          New York Sun

         <strong>

         Meanwhile, back in the real world, the scarf was not even a keffiyeh, but the campaign still cowed its target into submission. Dunkin’ Donuts announced in a statement (

          Boston Globe

         , 5/28/08): “In a recent online ad, Rachael Ray is wearing a black-and-white silk scarf with a paisley design. It was selected by her stylist for the advertising shoot. Absolutely no symbolism was intended. However, given the possibility of misperception, we are no longer using the commercial.” Malkin responded (5/28/08): “It’s refreshing to see an American company show sensitivity to the concerns of Americans opposed to Islamic jihad and its apologists.”

         Others might find a word other than “refreshing” to characterize pulling an ad because it was mistakenly thought to include a clothing item associated with a particular ethnic group.

         In the 1990 Polish elections a whispering campaign suggesting Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Roman Catholic, was a “secret Jew” attracted widespread attention in the U.S. press, as did a nearly identical rumor about the leading challenger in Poland’s 1995 election. In no uncertain terms, U.S. news reports called the rumors “ugly examples” (

We do not divide ourselves into “true ethnic Americans” and those of other “nations.” People of all races, religions and national origins are, we believe, fully entitled to the name American.

         columnist Richard Cohen (11/16/90) explained the persistence of the false rumor that the Polish candidate was secretly a Jew as an expression of “Poland’s peculiar cultural virus,” remarking, “What are facts when contrasted with prejudice?” Cohen described such an affair as a measure of “a country’s moral temperature, of gauging its character and its ability to deal rationally with its problems instead of setting off down the road, club in hand, in the search for scapegoats.” It seems Poland’s “cultural virus” is not that peculiar.

         Despite the self-congratulatory words, the American campaign of 2008, like Poland in 1990, has seen Democratic candidate Barack Obama targeted by a relentless campaign suggesting he is a member of a religious minority—not a secret Jew, but a secret Muslim.

         So far, it seems as though they may be on to something. A Pew Research Center poll (6/18-29/08; reported 7/15/08) found that 12 percent of both Democrats and Republicans reported having the erroneous belief, while 10 percent of all voters profess to not knowing his religion because they’ve “heard different things” about it. Fifty-two percent of respondents who knew Obama was a Christian intended to vote for him, versus 37 percent of those who mistakenly believed he was Muslim.

         But with few exceptions, media have not reacted nearly as forcefully to the bigotry behind the rumor campaign on their own turf as they did when the tactic was tried in Poland. Instead, journalists often accepted the idea that there was something suspicious or bad about being Muslim by referring to the canard as a “smear” (

In other words, according to Stewart’s analogy, the suggestion that you attended an Islamic school is tantamount to the claim that you are likely to blow up the planet.

         While the Post’s Cohen devoted two entire columns to Obama’s “pastor problem”—first (1/15/08) asking where Obama’s “sense of outrage” was over his pastor Jeremiah Wright’s “praise for an anti- Semitic demagogue” (Louis Farrakhan), and then, after Obama denounced Farrakhan’s comments, asking (3/18/08) why it took so long—he has given the anti-Muslim rumor campaign against Obama a mere two sentences (4/22/08, 7/1/08).

         In this context, it’s not surprising that the number of Muslims running for political office in the U.S. is declining from its already small number, according to the American Muslim Alliance (

         , 6/30/06). In 2000, some 700 Muslims (out of a population of more than 2 million, Pew, 5/22/07) ran for office in the U.S.—a figure that plummeted 90 percent to just 70 in 2002 and had only crept up to 100 by 2004.

         With the Islamophobic premise behind the rumor campaign going largely unquestioned, Muslims have been repeatedly shunned in the 2008 race. One glaring example was at a campaign event in Detroit where Obama staff took two women wearing hijabs, traditional head scarves, out of the view of TV cameras—a clear message, as one of the women put it (
         <strong>

         Later that month, the Obama campaign started a website called “Fight the Smears’’ to, “among other things, debunk portrayals of Obama as a Muslim” (

Shortly after this online “exposé,” the
         <strong>
          Wall Street Journal
         </strong>
         (8/6/08) pointed out that an imam who was a past member of the Islamic trust board had been charged in a State Department investigation of alleged racketeering and fundraising for Hamas, a case that ended in a mistrial. Asbahi had resigned from the board after hearing of the charges against his fellow board member, yet this tenuous association was enough to prompt Asbahi to resign from the Obama campaign in anticipation of the distraction the media coverage would create.

         Much has been made in the media about the unknown origins of some of the anti-Muslim rumors about Obama. The
         <strong>
          Washington Post
         </strong>
         (6/28/08), for instance, published a lengthy investigation of these email rumors under the headline “An Attack That Came Out of the Ether,” and
         <strong>
          CNN
         </strong>
         ’s Joe Johns (
         <strong>
          CNN Newsroom
         </strong>
         , 7/15/08) has described the rumors that Obama is a Muslim as originating from “the dark side of the Internet.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Islamophobia in the current election cycle may have started in “the ether,” but the record shows it has run into too little resistance from media and political elites, who have done too little to reject it and, in some cases, served to advance it.

           What’s FAIR
          </h4>
          <p>
           FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. We work to invigorate the First Amendment by advocating for greater diversity in the press and by scrutinizing media practices that marginalize public interest, minority and dissenting viewpoints. We expose neglected news stories and defend working journalists when they are muzzled. As a progressive group, we believe that structural reform is ultimately needed to break up the dominant media conglomerates, establish independent public broadcasting and promote strong non-profit sources of information.
